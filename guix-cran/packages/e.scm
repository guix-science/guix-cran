Hooke-Jeeves optimizer to find the best set of tuning parameters.  The user can
choose the optimizer, the learning method, and if optimization will be based on
accuracy obtained through validation error, cross validation, or resubstitution.
 The function eztune.cv will compute a cross validated error rate.  The purpose
of eztune_cv is to provide a cross validated accuracy or MSE when resubstitution
or validation data are used for optimization because error measures from both
approaches can be misleading.")

of transforming binocular data and gap repair to event-based processing such as
fixations, saccades, and entry/duration in Areas of Interest (AOIs).  It also
offers visualisation of eye movement and AOI entries.  These tools take
relatively raw (trial, time, x, and y form) data and can be used to return
fixations, saccades, and AOI entries and time spent in AOIs.  As the tools rely
on this basic data format, the functions can work with data from any eye

way to assert that x is both greater than 3 and less than 6 (see for example
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator>), a chaining operator is
implemented.  The chaining operator, %c%, allows multiple relational operations
to be used in quotes on the right hand side for the same object, on the left
hand side.  The %e% operator allows something like set-builder notation (see for
example <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation>) to be used on the
right hand side.  All operators have built in prefixes defined for all, subset,
and which to reduce the amount of code needed for common tasks, such as return
those values that are true.")

compare the results obtained by the application of the above theorems with those
calculated by the direct application of the Binomial formula.  Is basically

     "Current layout algorithms such as Kamada Kawai do not take into consideration
disjoint clusters in a network, often resulting in a high overlap among the
clusters, resulting in a visual âhairballâ that often is uninterpretable.
The @code{ExplodeLayout} algorithm takes as input (1) an edge list of a
unipartite or bipartite network, (2) node layout coordinates (x, y) generated by
a layout algorithm such as Kamada Kawai, (3) node cluster membership generated
from a clustering algorithm such as modularity maximization, and (4) a radius to
enable the node clusters to be âexplodedâ to reduce their overlap.  The
algorithm uses these inputs to generate new layout coordinates of the nodes
which âexplodesâ the clusters apart, such that the edge lengths within the
clusters are preserved, while the edge lengths between clusters are
recalculated.  The modified network layout with nodes and edges are displayed in
two dimensions.  The user can experiment with different explode radii to
generate a layout which has sufficient separation of clusters, while reducing
the overall layout size of the network.  This package is a basic version of an
earlier version called [epl]<https://github.com/UTMB-DIVA-Lab/epl> that searched
for an optimal explode radius, and offered multiple ways to separate clusters in
a network (Bhavnani et al(2017)
<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5543384/>).  The example dataset is
for a bipartite network, but the algorithm can work also for unipartite
networks.")

    (description
     "Generates feature matrix outputs from R object inputs using a variety of
expansion functions.  The generated feature matrices have applications as inputs
for a variety of machine learning algorithms.  The expansion functions are based
on coercing the input to a matrix, treating the columns as features and
converting individual columns or combinations into blocks of columns.  Currently
these include expansion of columns by efficient sparse embedding by vectors of
lags, quadratic expansion into squares and unique products, powers by vectors of
degree, vectors of orthogonal polynomials functions, and block random affine
projection transformations (RAPTs).  The transformations are magrittr- and
cbind-friendly, and can be used in a building block fashion.  For instance,
taking the @code{cos()} of the output of the RAPT transformation generates a
stationary kernel expansion via Bochner's theorem, and this expansion can then
be cbind-ed with other features.  Additionally, there are utilities for
replacing features, removing rows with NAs, creating matrix samples of a given
distribution, a simple wrapper for LASSO with CV, a Freeman-Tukey transform,
generalizations of the outer function, matrix size-preserving discrete
difference by row, plotting, etc.")

described in Northrop (2015) <doi:10.1007/s10687-015-0221-5> and Berghaus and
Bucher (2018) <doi:10.1214/17-AOS1621>.  Sliding block maxima are used to
increase precision of estimation.  A graphical block size diagnostic is
provided.  The other type of methodology uses a model for the distribution of
threshold inter-exceedance times (Ferro and Segers (2003)
<doi:10.1111/1467-9868.00401>).  Three versions of this type of approach are

D-gaps models this package allows missing values in the data, can accommodate

    (description
     "Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs) are a method of comparative demographic
analysis.  The purpose is to quantify how the difference or variance in vital
rates (stage-specific survival, growth, and fertility) among populations
contributes to difference or variance in the population growth rate, \"lambda.\"
We provide functions for one-way fixed design and random design LTRE, using
either the classical methods that have been in use for several decades, or an
@code{fANOVA-based} exact method that directly calculates the impact on lambda
of changes in matrix elements, for matrix elements and their interactions.  The
equations and descriptions for the classical methods of LTRE analysis can be
found in Caswell (2001, ISBN: 0878930965), and the @code{fANOVA-based} exact
methods are described in Hernandez et al. (2023) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14065>.
We also provide some demographic functions, including generation time from
Bienvenu and Legendre (2015) <doi:10.1086/681104>.  For implementation of
@code{exactLTRE} where all possible interactions are calculated, we use an
operator matrix presented in Poelwijk, Krishna, and Ranganathan (2016)

tool for exploring the distribution of small sample size data.  For a sample of
size n, the exact bootstrap method generates the entire space of n to the power
of n resamples and calculates all realizations of the selected statistic.  The
exactamente package includes functions for implementing two bootstrap methods,
the exact bootstrap and the regular bootstrap.  The @code{exact_bootstrap()}
function applies the exact bootstrap method following methodologies outlined in
Kisielinska (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00180-012-0350-0>.  The
@code{regular_bootstrap()} function offers a more traditional bootstrap
approach, where users can determine the number of resamples.  The
@code{e_vs_r()} function allows users to directly compare results from these
bootstrap methods.  To augment user experience, exactamente includes the
function @code{exactamente_app()} which launches an interactive shiny web
application.  This application facilitates exploration and comparison of the
bootstrap methods, providing options for modifying various parameters and
visualizing results.")

occurrence of a crisis, which is represented by a binary variable which takes
the value of one when the event occurs, and the value of zero otherwise.  EWS
are a toolbox for policymakers to prevent or attenuate the impact of economic
downturns.  Modern EWS are based on the econometric framework of Kauppi and
Saikkonen (2008) <doi:10.1162/rest.90.4.777>.  Specifically, this framework
includes four dichotomous models, relying on a logit approach to model the
relationship between yield spreads and future recessions, controlling for
recession risk factors.  These models can be estimated in a univariate or a
balanced panel framework as in Candelon, Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2014)
<doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.03.015>.  This package provides both methods for
estimating these models and a dataset covering 13 OECD countries over a period
of 45 years.  In addition, this package also provides methods for the analysis
of the propagation mechanisms of an exogenous shock, as well as robust
confidence intervals for these response functions using a block-bootstrap method
as in Lajaunie (2021).  This package constitutes a useful toolbox (data and

are recursive partitioning methods that build the model in a forward stepwise

results of recursive tree methods are only locally optimal, as splits are chosen
to maximize homogeneity at the next step only.  An alternative way to search
over the parameter space of trees is to use global optimization methods like
evolutionary algorithms.  The evtree package implements an evolutionary
algorithm for learning globally optimal classification and regression trees in
R. CPU and memory-intensive tasks are fully computed in C++ while the partykit
package is leveraged to represent the resulting trees in R, providing unified
infrastructure for summaries, visualizations, and predictions.")

event-specific win ratios for semi-competing risks data with non-terminal and
terminal events, as developed in Yang et al. (2021<doi:10.1002/sim.9266>).
Compared with conventional methods for survival data, these procedures are
designed to utilize more data for improved inference procedures with
semi-competing risks data.  The event-specific win ratios were introduced in
Yang and Troendle (2021<doi:10.1177/1740774520972408>).  In this package, the
event-specific win ratios and confidence intervals are obtained for each event
type, and several testing procedures are developed for the global null of no
treatment effect on either terminal or non-terminal events.  Furthermore, a test
of proportional hazard assumptions, under which the event-specific win ratios
converge to the hazard ratios, and a test of equal hazard ratios are provided.
For summarizing the treatment effect on all events, confidence intervals for
linear combinations of the event-specific win ratios are available using
pre-determined or data-driven weights.  Asymptotic properties of these inference
procedures are discussed in Yang et al (2021<doi:10.1002/sim.9266>).  Also,
transformations are used to yield better control of the type one error rates for
moderately sized data sets.")

evenly distributed among the 4 players, the rest of the suits are more likely to
be evenly distributed.  Our mathematical analyses show that, if one suit is
found to be evenly distributed, then a second suit has a slightly elevated
probability (ranging between 10% to 15%) of being evenly distributed.  If two
suits are found to be evenly distributed, then a third suit has a substantially
elevated probability (ranging between 30% to 50%) of being evenly
distributed.This package refers to methods and authentic data from Ely

    (description
     "The purpose of this library is to compute the optimal charging cost function for
a electric vehicle (EV).  It is well known that the charging function of a EV is
a concave function that can be approximated by a piece-wise linear function, so
bigger the state of charge, slower the charging process is.  Moreover, the other
important function is the one that gives the electricity price.  This function
is usually step-wise, since depending on the time of the day, the price of the
electricity is different.  Then, the problem of charging an EV to a certain
state of charge is not trivial.  This library implements an algorithm to compute
the optimal charging cost function, that is, it plots for a given state of
charge r (between 0 and 1) the minimum cost we need to pay in order to charge
the EV to that state of charge r.  The details of the algorithm are described in

registered clinical trial results; thus aiming to prevent non-reporting of
negative results and provide open-access to results to inform future research.
The amount of information required and the format of the results, however,
imposes a large extra workload at the end of studies on clinical trial units.
In particular, the adverse-event-reporting component requires entering: each
unique combination of treatment group and safety event; for every such event
above, a further 4 pieces of information (body system, number of occurrences,
number of subjects, number exposed) for non-serious events, plus an extra three
pieces of data for serious adverse events (numbers of causally related events,
deaths, causally related deaths).  This package prepares the required statistics
needed by @code{EudraCT} and formats them into the precise requirements to
directly upload an XML file into the web portal, with no further data entry by
hand.")

 This package helps a user guess four things (mean, MD, scaled MSD, and RMSD)
before they get the SD. 1) The package displays the Empirical Cumulative
Distribution Function (ECDF) of the given data.  The user must choose the value
of the mean by equating the areas of two colored (blue and green) regions.  The
package gives feedback to improve the choice until it is correct.
Alternatively, the reader may continue with a different guess for the center
(not necessarily the mean).  2) The user chooses the values of the Mean
Deviation (MD) based on the ECDF of the deviations by equating the areas of two
newly colored (blue and green) regions, with feedback from the package until the
user guesses correctly.  3) The user chooses the Scaled Mean Squared Deviation
(MSD) based on the ECDF of the scaled square deviations by equating the areas of
two newly colored (blue and green) regions, with feedback from the package until
the user guesses correctly.  4) The user chooses the Root Mean Squared Deviation
(RMSD) by ensuring that its intersection with the ECDF of the deviations is at
the same height as the intersection between the scaled MSD and the ECDF of the
scaled squared deviations.  Additionally, the intersection of two blue lines
(the green dot) should fall on the vertical line at the maximum deviation.  5)
Finally, if the mean is chosen correctly, only then the user can view the
population SD (the same as the RMSD) and the sample SD (sqrt(n/(n-1))*RMSD) by
clicking the respective buttons.  If the mean is chosen incorrectly, the user is
asked to correct it.")

standard errors of the ETAS model parameter estimates is based on the Hessian
matrix derived from the log-likelihood function of the fitted model.  However,
when an ETAS model is fitted to a local data set over a time period that is
limited or short, the standard errors based on the Hessian matrix may be
inaccurate.  It follows that the asymptotic confidence intervals for parameters
may not always be reliable.  As an alternative, this package allows for the
construction of bootstrap confidence intervals based on empirical quantiles for
the parameters of the 2-D spatial and temporal ETAS model.  This version
improves on Version 0.1.0 of the package by enabling the study space window
(renamed study region') to be polygonal rather than merely rectangular.  A Japan
earthquake data catalog is used in a second example to illustrate this new
feature.")

yield trials with growth simulations using a state-of-the-art single-tree growth
simulator.  By doing so, the new yield tables reflect the current increment
level and the recommended graduated thinning from above is the underlying
management concept.  The yield tables are provided along with methods for
deriving the site index and for interpolating between age and site indices and
extrapolating beyond age and site index ranges.  The inter-/extrapolations are
performed traditionally by the rule of proportion or with a functional approach.")

    (description
     "This package provides a variety of methods are provided to estimate and
visualize distributional differences in terms of effect sizes.  Particular
emphasis is upon evaluating differences between two or more distributions across
the entire scale, rather than at a single point (e.g., differences in means).
For example, Probability-Probability (PP) plots display the difference between
two or more distributions, matched by their empirical CDFs (see Ho and Reardon,
2012; <doi:10.3102/1076998611411918>), allowing for examinations of where on the
scale distributional differences are largest or smallest.  The area under the PP
curve (AUC) is an effect-size metric, corresponding to the probability that a
randomly selected observation from the x-axis distribution will have a higher
value than a randomly selected observation from the y-axis distribution.  Binned
effect size plots are also available, in which the distributions are split into
bins (set by the user) and separate effect sizes (Cohen's d) are produced for
each bin - again providing a means to evaluate the consistency (or lack thereof)
of the difference between two or more distributions at different points on the
scale.  Evaluation of empirical CDFs is also provided, with built-in arguments
for providing annotations to help evaluate distributional differences at
specific points (e.g., semi-transparent shading).  All function take a
consistent argument structure.  Calculation of specific effect sizes is also
possible.  The following effect sizes are estimable: (a) Cohen's d, (b) Hedges
g, (c) percentage above a cut, (d) transformed (normalized) percentage above a
cut, (e) area under the PP curve, and (f) the V statistic (see Ho, 2009;
<doi:10.3102/1076998609332755>), which essentially transforms the area under the
curve to standard deviation units.  By default, effect sizes are calculated for
all possible pairwise comparisons, but a reference group (distribution) can be
specified.")

     "This package performs analyzes and estimates of environmental covariates and
genetic parameters related to selection strategies and development of superior
genotypes.  It has two main functionalities, the first being about prediction
models of covariates and environmental processes, while the second deals with
the estimation of genetic parameters and selection strategies.  Designed for
researchers and professionals in genetics and environmental sciences, the
package combines statistical methods for modeling and data analysis.  This
includes the plastochron estimate proposed by Porta et al. (2024)

meanwhile recovers the features, such as increases or modes, with both false
positive and false negative controls.  Moreover, it provides a parsimonious
representation in terms of the number of blocks, which simplifies data
interpretation.  The only assumption for the method is that data points are
independent and identically distributed, so it applies to fairly general
situations, including continuous distributions, discrete distributions, and
mixtures of both.  For details see Li, Munk, Sieling and Walther (2016)

     "The experiment selector cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator
(ES-CVTMLE) aims to select the experiment that optimizes the bias-variance
tradeoff for estimating a causal average treatment effect (ATE) where different
experiments may include a randomized controlled trial (RCT) alone or an RCT
combined with real-world data.  Using cross-validation, the ES-CVTMLE separates
the selection of the optimal experiment from the estimation of the ATE for the
chosen experiment.  The estimated bias term in the selector is a function of the
difference in conditional mean outcome under control for the RCT compared to the
combined experiment.  In order to help include truly unbiased external data in
the analysis, the estimated average treatment effect on a negative control
outcome may be added to the bias term in the selector.  For more details about
this method, please see Dang et al. (2022) <@code{arXiv:2210.05802>}.")

provide implementations of many dose-finding clinical trial designs, including
the continual reassessment method (CRM) by O'Quigley et al. (1990)
<doi:10.2307/2531628>, the toxicity probability interval (TPI) design by Ji et
al. (2007) <doi:10.1177/1740774507079442>, the modified TPI (@code{mTPI}) design
by Ji et al. (2010) <doi:10.1177/1740774510382799>, the Bayesian optimal
interval design (BOIN) by Liu & Yuan (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12089>,
@code{EffTox} by Thall & Cook (2004) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00218.x>; the
design of Wages & Tait (2015) <doi:10.1080/10543406.2014.920873>, and the 3+3
described by Korn et al. (1994) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780131802>.  All designs are
implemented with a common interface.  We also offer optional additional classes
to tailor the behaviour of all designs, including avoiding skipping doses,
stopping after n patients have been treated at the recommended dose, stopping
when a toxicity condition is met, or demanding that n patients are treated
before stopping is allowed.  By daisy-chaining together these classes using the
pipe operator from magrittr', it is simple to tailor the behaviour of a
dose-finding design so it behaves how the trialist wants.  Having provided a
flexible interface for specifying designs, we then provide functions to run
simulations and calculate dose-paths for future cohorts of patients.")

    (description
     "This package provides functions for signal detection and identification designed
for Event-Related Potentials (ERP) data in a linear model framework.  The
functional F-test proposed in Causeur, Sheu, Perthame, Rufini (2018, submitted)
for analysis of variance issues in ERP designs is implemented for signal
detection (tests for mean difference among groups of curves in One-way ANOVA
designs for example).  Once an experimental effect is declared significant,
identification of significant intervals is achieved by the multiple testing
procedures reviewed and compared in Sheu, Perthame, Lee and Causeur (2016,
<DOI:10.1214/15-AOAS888>).  Some of the methods gathered in the package are the
classical FDR- and FWER-controlling procedures, also available using function
p.adjust.  The package also implements the Guthrie-Buchwald procedure (Guthrie
and Buchwald, 1991 <DOI:10.1111/j.1469-8986.1991.tb00417.x>), which accounts for
the auto-correlation among t-tests to control erroneous detection of short
intervals.  The Adaptive Factor-Adjustment method is an extension of the method
described in Causeur, Chu, Hsieh and Sheu (2012,
<DOI:10.3758/s13428-012-0230-0>).  It assumes a factor model for the correlation
among tests and combines adaptively the estimation of the signal and the
updating of the dependence modelling (see Sheu et al., 2016,
<DOI:10.1214/15-AOAS888> for further details).")

ergmito circumvents using Markov-Chain Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MC-MLE) and
instead uses Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) to fit ERGMs for small networks.
 As exhaustive enumeration is computationally feasible for small networks, this
R package takes advantage of this and provides tools for calculating likelihood
functions, and other relevant functions, directly, meaning that in many cases
both estimation and simulation of ERGMs for small networks can be faster and
more accurate than simulation-based algorithms.")

standard deviation of the reference distribution.  The first method assumes a
fixed margin which is a constant multiple of the estimated standard deviation of
the reference data and whose variability is ignored.  The second method takes

equivalence (or non-inferiority) of two survival curves, obtained from two given
datasets.  The test is based on the creation of confidence intervals at
pre-specified time points.  For the non-parametric approach, the curves are
given by Kaplan-Meier curves and the variance for calculating the confidence
intervals is obtained by Greenwood's formula.  The parametric approach is based
on estimating the underlying distribution, where the user can choose between a
Weibull, Exponential, Gaussian, Logistic, Log-normal or a Log-logistic
distribution.  Estimates for the variance for calculating the confidence bands
are obtained by a (parametric) bootstrap approach.  For this bootstrap censoring
is assumed to be exponentially distributed and estimates are obtained from the
datasets under consideration.  All details can be found in K.Moellenhoff and
A.Tresch: Survival analysis under non-proportional hazards: investigating

    (description
     "In agricultural, post-harvest and processing, engineering and industrial
experiments factors are often differentiated with ease with which they can
change from experimental run to experimental run.  This is due to the fact that
one or more factors may be expensive or time consuming to change i.e.
hard-to-change factors.  These factors restrict the use of complete
randomization as it may make the experiment expensive and time consuming.  Split
plot designs can be used for such situations.  In general model estimation of
split plot designs require the use of generalized least squares (GLS).  However
for some split-plot designs ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are
equivalent to generalized least squares (GLS) estimates.  These types of designs
are known in literature as equivalent-estimation split-plot design.  For method
details see, Macharia, H. and Goos, P.(2010)
<doi:10.1080/00224065.2010.11917833>.Balanced split plot designs are designs
which have an equal number of subplots within every whole plot.  This package
used to construct equivalent estimation balanced split plot designs for
different experimental set ups along with different statistical criteria to
measure the performance of these designs.  It consist of the function
@code{equivalent_BSPD()}.")

     "The EQ-5D is a widely-used standarized instrument for measuring Health Related
Quality Of Life (HRQOL), developed by the @code{EuroQol} group
<https://euroqol.org/>.  It assesses five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, using either a three-level
(EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.  Scores from these dimensions are
commonly converted into a single utility index using country-specific value
sets, which are critical in clinical and economic evaluations of healthcare and
in population health surveys.  The eq5dsuite package enables users to calculate
utility index values for the EQ-5D instruments, including crosswalk utilities
using the original crosswalk developed by van Hout et al. (2012)
<doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008> (mapping EQ-5D-5L responses to EQ-5D-3L index
values), or the recently developed reverse crosswalk by van Hout et al. (2021)
<doi:10.1016/j.jval.2021.03.009> (mapping EQ-5D-3L responses to EQ-5D-5L index
values).  Users are allowed to add and/or remove user-defined value sets.
Additionally, the package provides tools to analyze EQ-5D data according to the
recommended guidelines outlined in \"Methods for Analyzing and Reporting EQ-5D
data\" by Devlin et al. (2020) <doi:10.1007/978-3-030-47622-9>.")

    (description
     "EQ-5D is a popular health related quality of life instrument used in the
clinical and economic evaluation of health care.  Developed by the
@code{EuroQol} group <https://euroqol.org/>, the instrument consists of two
components: health state description and evaluation.  For the description
component a subject self-rates their health in terms of five dimensions;
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression
using either a three-level (EQ-5D-3L,
<https://euroqol.org/information-and-support/euroqol-instruments/eq-5d-3l/>) or
a five-level (EQ-5D-5L,
<https://euroqol.org/information-and-support/euroqol-instruments/eq-5d-5l/>)
scale.  Frequently the scores on these five dimensions are converted to a single
utility index using country specific value sets, which can be used in the
clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health
surveys.  The eq5d package provides methods to calculate index scores from a
subject's dimension scores.  32 TTO and 11 VAS EQ-5D-3L value sets including
those for countries in Szende et al (2007) <doi:10.1007/1-4020-5511-0> and
Szende et al (2014) <doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7596-1>, 47 EQ-5D-5L EQ-VT value
sets, the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk value sets developed by van Hout et al. (2012)
<doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008>, the crosswalk value sets for Bermuda, Jordan
and Russia and the van Hout (2021) reverse crosswalk value sets.  10 EQ-5D-Y
value sets are also included as are the NICE DSU age-sex based EQ-5D-3L to
EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-5L to EQ-5D-3L mappings.  Methods are also included for the
analysis of EQ-5D profiles, including those from the book \"Methods for Analyzing
and Reporting EQ-5D data\" by Devlin et al. (2020)
<doi:10.1007/978-3-030-47622-9>.  Additionally a shiny web tool is included to

     "This package provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal
e-book content from EPUB files.  The epubr package provides functions supporting
the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files.  E-book
metadata and text content are parsed separately and joined together in a tidy,
nested tibble data frame.  E-book formatting is not completely standardized
across all literature.  It can be challenging to curate parsed e-book content
across an arbitrary collection of e-books perfectly and in completely general
form, to yield a singular, consistently formatted output.  Many EPUB files do
not even contain all the same pieces of information in their respective
metadata.  EPUB file parsing functionality in this package is intended for
relatively general application to arbitrary EPUB e-books.  However, poorly
formatted e-books or e-books with highly uncommon formatting may not work with
this package.  There may even be cases where an EPUB file has DRM or some other
property that makes it impossible to read with epubr'.  Text is read as is for
the most part.  The only nominal changes are minor substitutions, for example
curly quotes changed to straight quotes.  Substantive changes are expected to be
performed subsequently by the user as part of their text analysis.  Additional
text cleaning can be performed at the user's discretion, such as with functions
from packages like tm or qdap'.")

templates for epidemic modeling include SI, SIR, and SIS disease types.
@code{EpiModel} features an API for extending these templates to address novel

modeling, including: bias correction, spatial cross-validation, model
evaluation, raster interpolation, biotic \"velocity\" (speed and direction of
movement of a \"mass\" represented by a raster), interpolating across a time
series of rasters, and use of spatially imprecise records.  The heart of the
package is a set of \"training\" functions which automatically optimize model
complexity based number of available occurrences.  These algorithms include
@code{MaxEnt}, @code{MaxNet}, boosted regression trees/gradient boosting
machines, generalized additive models, generalized linear models, natural
splines, and random forests.  To enhance interoperability with other modeling
packages, no new classes are created.  The package works with PROJ6 geodetic
objects and coordinate reference systems.")

By using a set of negative control hypotheses we can estimate the empirical null
distribution of a particular observational study setup.  This empirical null
distribution can be used to compute a calibrated p-value, which reflects the
probability of observing an estimated effect size when the null hypothesis is
true taking both random and systematic error into account.  A similar approach
can be used to calibrate confidence intervals, using both negative and positive
controls.  For more details, see Schuemie et al. (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5925>

set by considering the weight of the intensity corresponding to the measurement

package efficiently estimates the parameters of Gaussian mixture model during
iterative calculation between E-step and M-step, and the parameters are
converged to a local optimal solution.  This package can support the
investigation of peak shift with two advantages: (1) a large amount of data can
be processed at high speed; and (2) stable and automatic calculation can be
easily performed.")

supported.  Additionally, users can specify their own likelihood function and/or
choose for non-hierarchical estimation, as well as for a diagonal, blocked or
full multivariate normal group-level distribution to test individual
differences.  Prior specification is facilitated through methods that visualize
the (implied) prior.  A wide range of plotting functions assist in assessing
model convergence and posterior inference.  Models can be easily evaluated using
functions that plot posterior predictions or using relative model comparison

but deeply rooted in frequentist regularization methods by utilizing
ExpectationâMaximization (EM) algorithm.  The spike-and-slab quantile LASSO
can handle data irregularity in terms of skewness and outliers in response
variables, compared to its non-robust alternative, the spike-and-slab LASSO,
which has also been implemented in the package.  In addition, procedures for
fitting the spike-and-slab quantile group LASSO and its non-robust counterpart
have been implemented in the form of quantile/least-square varying coefficient
mixed effect models for high-dimensional longitudinal data.  The core module of
this package is developed in C++'.")

assessed by human raters.  Stimuli are presented as sequence of pairwise
comparisons ('contests'), during each of which a rater expresses preference for
one stimulus over the other (forced choice).  The algorithm for calculating
global scores is based on Elo rating, which updates individual scores after each
single pairwise contest.  Elo rating is widely used to rank chess players
according to their performance.  Its core feature is that dyadic contests with
expected outcomes lead to smaller changes of participants scores than outcomes
that were unexpected.  As such, Elo rating is an efficient tool to rate
individual stimuli when a large number of such stimuli are paired against each
other in the context of experiments where the goal is to rank stimuli according
to some characteristic of interest.  Clark et al (2018)

    (description
     "An eikosogram (ancient Greek for probability picture) divides the unit square
into rectangular regions whose areas, sides, and widths, represent various
probabilities associated with the values of one or more categorical variates.
Rectangle areas are joint probabilities, widths are always marginal (though
possibly joint margins, i.e.  marginal joint distributions of two or more
variates), and heights of rectangles are always conditional probabilities.
Eikosograms embed the rules of probability and are useful for introducing
elementary probability theory, including axioms, marginal, conditional, and
joint probabilities, and their relationships (including Bayes theorem as a
completely trivial consequence).  They are markedly superior to Venn diagrams
for this purpose, especially in distinguishing probabilistic independence,
mutually exclusive events, coincident events, and associations.  They also are
useful for identifying and understanding conditional independence structure.  As
data analysis tools, eikosograms display categorical data in a manner similar to
Mosaic plots, especially when only two variates are involved (the only case in
which they are essentially identical, though eikosograms purposely disallow
spacing between rectangles).  Unlike Mosaic plots, eikosograms do not alternate
axes as each new categorical variate (beyond two) is introduced.  Instead, only
one categorical variate, designated the \"response\", presents on the vertical
axis and all others, designated the \"conditioning\" variates, appear on the
horizontal.  In this way, conditional probability appears only as height and
marginal probabilities as widths.  The eikosogram is therefore much better
suited to a response model analysis (e.g. logistic model) than is a Mosaic plot.
 Mosaic plots are better suited to log-linear style modelling as in discrete
multivariate analysis.  Of course, eikosograms are also suited to discrete
multivariate analysis with each variate in turn appearing as the response.  This
makes it better suited than Mosaic plots to discrete graphical models based on
conditional independence graphs (i.e. \"Bayesian Networks\" or
\"@code{BayesNets}\").  The eikosogram and its superiority to Venn diagrams in
teaching probability is described in W.H. Cherry and R.W. Oldford (2003)
<https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~rwoldfor/papers/eikosograms/paper.pdf>, its value in
exploring conditional independence structure and relation to graphical and
log-linear models is described in R.W. Oldford (2003)
<https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~rwoldfor/papers/eikosograms/independence/paper.pdf>,
and a number of problems, puzzles, and paradoxes that are easily explained with
eikosograms are given in R.W. Oldford (2003)

direct effects of each species on each of the others, and are estimated
alongside the effects of missing covariates, modelled as latent factors.  The

     "This package implements methods for functional data analysis based on the
epigraph and hypograph indices.  These methods transform functional datasets,
whether in one or multiple dimensions, into multivariate datasets.  The
transformation involves applying the epigraph, hypograph, and their modified
versions to both the original curves and their first and second derivatives.
The calculation of these indices is tailored to the dimensionality of the
functional dataset, with special considerations for dependencies between
dimensions in multidimensional cases.  This approach extends traditional
multivariate data analysis techniques to the functional data setting.  A key
application of this package is the E@code{HyClus} method, which enhances
clustering analysis for functional data across one or multiple dimensions using
the epigraph and hypograph indices.  See Pulido et al. (2023)

     "Leveraging eQTLs to Identify Individual-Level Tissue of Interest for a Complex Trait")
    (description
     "Genetic predisposition for complex traits is often manifested through multiple
tissues of interest at different time points in the development.  As an example,
the genetic predisposition for obesity could be manifested through inherited
variants that control metabolism through regulation of genes expressed in the
brain and/or through the control of fat storage in the adipose tissue by
dysregulation of genes expressed in adipose tissue.  We present a method
@code{eGST} (@code{eQTL-based} genetic subtyper) that integrates tissue-specific
@code{eQTLs} with GWAS data for a complex trait to probabilistically assign a
tissue of interest to the phenotype of each individual in the study. @code{eGST}
estimates the posterior probability that an individual's phenotype can be
assigned to a tissue based on individual-level genotype data of tissue-specific
@code{eQTLs} and marginal phenotype data in a genome-wide association study
(GWAS) cohort.  Under a Bayesian framework of mixture model, @code{eGST} employs
a maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate
the tissue-specific posterior probability across individuals.  Methodology is
available from: A Majumdar, C Giambartolomei, N Cai, MK Freund, T Haldar, T
Schwarz, J Flint, B Pasaniuc (2019) <doi:10.1101/674226>.")

 Unique Variable Analysis evaluates the extent to which items are locally
dependent (or redundant).  Network loadings provide similar information to
factor loadings and can be used to compute network scores.  A bootstrap and
permutation approach are available to assess configural and metric invariance.
Hierarchical structures can be detected using Hierarchical EGA. Time series and

The image is first transformed into the wavelet domain in order to decorrelate
any noise components, following which the coefficients at each resolution are
standardised.  Statistical tests (in a multiple hypothesis testing setting) are
then carried out to find the anomalies.  The power of EFDR exceeds that of
standard FDR, which would carry out tests on every wavelet coefficient: EFDR
choose which wavelets to test based on a criterion described in Shen et al.

irregular data onto a grid of the required size.  The work is based on Shen, X.,

(1965) <doi:10.1007/BF02289447> based on eigenvalues form PCA or EFA are readily
available.  This package also implements several newer methods, such as the
Empirical Kaiser Criterion (EKC) by Braeken and van Assen (2017)

analysis, principal axis factor analysis, maximum likelihood factor analysis,
image factor analysis, and extension factor analysis, all of which can take raw
data or correlation matrices as input and with options for conducting the
analyses using Pearson correlations, Kendall correlations, Spearman
correlations, gamma correlations, or polychoric correlations.  Varimax rotation,
promax rotation, and Procrustes rotations can be performed.  Additional
functions focus on the factorability of a correlation matrix, the congruences
between factors from different datasets, the assessment of local independence,
the assessment of factor solution complexity, and internal consistency.

entropy measure, equally sensitive to all parts of the distribution; and
finally, the GE measure when the sensitivity parameter is set equal to 2, which
gives more weight to differences in higher education.  The decomposition of
these measures in the components between-country and within-country inequality

Distance between the Non-standardized Expected values\".  The EDNE-test for
equivalence is a multivariate two-sample equivalence test.  Distance measure of
the test is the Euclidean distance.  The test is an asymptotically valid test
for the family of distributions fulfilling the assumptions of the multivariate
central limit theorem (see Hoffelder et al.,2015).  The function
@code{EDNE.EQ()} implements the EDNE-test for equivalence according to Hoffelder
et al. (2015).  The function @code{EDNE.EQ.dissolution.profiles()} implements a
variant of the EDNE-test for equivalence analyses of dissolution profiles (see
Suarez-Sharp et al.,2020 <DOI:10.1208/s12248-020-00458-9>).
@code{EDNE.EQ.dissolution.profiles()} checks whether the quadratic mean of the
differences of the expected values of both dissolution profile populations is
statistically significantly smaller than 10 [\\% of label claim].  The current
regulatory standard approach for equivalence analyses of dissolution profiles is
the similarity factor f2.  The statistical hypotheses underlying

learning rule, and essentially the same as Rescorla-Wagner's learning equations
(Rescorla & Wagner, 1972, ISBN: 0390718017), which are also at the core of Naive
Discrimination Learning, (Baayen et al, 2011, <doi:10.1037/a0023851>) can be
used to explain bottom-up human learning (Hoppe et al,
<doi:10.31234/osf.io/py5kd>), but is also at the core of artificial neural
networks applications in the form of the Delta rule.  This package provides a
set of functions for building small-scale simulations to investigate the
dynamics of error-driven learning and it's interaction with the structure of the
input.  For modeling error-driven learning using the Rescorla-Wagner equations
the package ndl (Baayen et al, 2011, <doi:10.1037/a0023851>) is available on
CRAN at <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ndl>.  However, the package
currently only allows tracing of a cue-outcome combination, rather than
returning the learned networks.  To fill this gap, we implemented a new package
with a few functions that facilitate inspection of the networks for small error
driven learning simulations.  Note that our functions are not optimized for
training large data sets (no parallel processing), as they are intended for
small scale simulations and course examples. (Consider the python implementation
pyndl <https://pyndl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> for that purpose.).")

Discovery Rate (IDR) method has been instrumental in assessing reproducibility,
its standard implementation is constrained to handling only two replicates.
Package @code{eCV} introduces an enhanced Coefficient of Variation (@code{eCV})
metric to assess the likelihood of omic features being reproducible.
Additionally, it offers alternatives to the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR)
calculations for multi-replicate experiments.  These tools are valuable for
analyzing high-throughput data in genomics and other omics fields.  The methods
implemented in @code{eCV} are described in Gonzalez-Reymundez et al., (2023)

bivariate plots, with trophic levels as the abscissa, and biomass flows or
related quantities as ordinates.  Thus, trophic ecosystem functioning can be
modelled as a continuous flow of biomass surging up the food web, from lower to
higher trophic levels, due to predation and ontogenic processes.  Such an
approach, wherein species as such disappear, may be viewed as the ultimate stage
in the use of the trophic level metric for ecosystem modelling, providing a
simplified but potentially useful caricature of ecosystem functioning and
impacts of fishing.  This version contains catch trophic spectrum analysis
(CTSA) function and corrected versions of the mf.diagnosis and create.ETmain

confidence limits desired for selected LC or LT for ecotoxicology studies
(Finney 1971; Wheeler et al.  2006; Robertson et al.  2007).  The simplicity of
ecotox comes from the syntax it implies within its functions which are similar
to functions like @code{glm()} and @code{lm()}.  In addition to the simplicity
of the syntax, a comprehensive data frame is produced which gives the user a
predicted LC or LT value for the desired level and a suite of important
parameters such as fiducial confidence limits and slope.  Finney, D.J. (1971,

ecological communities with @code{prep_data()} which formats and arranges the
initial data, and then the optimization follows the following procedure of four
functions: (1) @code{prep_data()} takes the original dataset and creates
simulated sets that can be used as a basis for estimating statistical power and
type II error. (2) @code{sim_beta()} is used to estimate the statistical power
for the different sampling efforts specified by the user. (3) @code{sim_cbo()}
calculates then the optimal sampling effort, based on the statistical power and
the sampling costs.  Additionally, (4) @code{scompvar()} calculates the
variation components necessary for (5) @code{Underwood_cbo()} to calculate the
optimal combination of number of sites and samples depending on either an
economic budget or on a desired statistical accuracy.  Lastly, (6)
@code{plot_power()} helps the user visualize the results of @code{sim_beta()}.")

    (description
     "Ensemble correlation-based low-rank matrix completion method (ECLRMC) is an
extension to the LRMC based methods.  Traditionally, the LRMC based methods give
identical importance to the whole data which results in emphasizing on the
commonality of the data and overlooking the subtle but crucial differences.
This method aims to overcome the equality assumption problem that exists in the
current LRMS based methods.  Ensemble correlation-based low-rank matrix
completion (ECLRMC) takes consideration of the specific characteristic of each
sample and performs LRMC on the set of samples with a strong correlation.  It
uses an ensemble learning method to improve the imputation performance.  Since
each sample is analyzed independently this method can be parallelized by
distributing imputation across many computation units or GPU platforms.  This
package provides three different methods (LRMC, CLRMC and ECLRMC) for data
imputation.  There is also an NRMS function for evaluating the result.  Chen,
Xiaobo, et al (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2017.06.010>.")

possible sparsity in the mean vector.  Within a Bayesian formulation, the
elements of the mean vector are modelled as having, independently, a
distribution that is a mixture of an atom of probability at zero and a suitable
heavy-tailed distribution.  The mixing parameter can be estimated by a marginal
maximum likelihood approach.  This leads to an adaptive thresholding approach on
the original data.  Extensions of the basic method, in particular to wavelet
thresholding, are also implemented within the package.")

error effects when constructing exponentially weighted moving average p control
charts.  The method primarily focuses on binary random variables, but it can be
applied to any continuous random variables by using sign statistic to transform
them to discrete ones.  With the correction of measurement error effects, we can
obtain the corrected control limits of exponentially weighted moving average p
control chart and reasonably adjusted exponentially weighted moving average p
control charts.  The methods in this package can be found in some relevant

is a continuous variable, the mean and standard deviation or median and
quartiles are automatically output; if the data is a categorical variable, the
number and percentage are automatically output.  In addition, if you enter two
variables in this package, the two variables will be described and their
relationships will be tested automatically according to their data types.  For
example, if one of the two input variables is a categorical variable, another
variable will be described hierarchically based on the categorical variable and
the statistical differences between different groups will be compared using
appropriate statistical methods.  And for groups of more than two, the post hoc
test will be applied.  For more information on the methods we used, please see

     "Implementation in a simple and efficient way of fully customisable population
genetics simulations, considering multiple loci that have epistatic
interactions.  Specifically suited to the modelling of multilocus
nucleocytoplasmic systems (with both diploid and haploid loci), it is
nevertheless possible to simulate purely diploid (or purely haploid) genetic
models.  Examples of models that can be simulated with Ease are numerous, for
example models of genetic incompatibilities as presented by Marie-Orleach et al.
(2022) <doi:10.1101/2022.07.25.501356>.  Many others are conceivable, although
few are actually explored, Ease having been developed in particular to provide a
solution so that these kinds of models can be simulated simply.")
