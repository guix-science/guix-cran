traditional random variable sampling.This new approach is particularly useful in
building models from high-dimensional data.")

    (description
     "This package provides a powerful yet simple graphical tool available in the
field of psychometrics is the Wright Map (also known as item maps or item-person
maps), which presents the location of both respondents and items on the same
scale.  Wright Maps are commonly used to present the results of dichotomous or
polytomous item response models.  The @code{WrightMap} package provides
functions to create these plots from item parameters and person estimates stored
as R objects.  Although the package can be used in conjunction with any software
used to estimate the IRT model (e.g. TAM', mirt', @code{eRm} or IRToys in R', or
Stata', Mplus', etc.), @code{WrightMap} features special integration with
@code{ConQuest} to facilitate reading and plotting its output directly.The
@code{wrightMap} function creates Wright Maps based on person estimates and item
parameters produced by an item response analysis.  The CQmodel function reads
output files created using @code{ConQuest} software and creates a set of data
frames for easy data manipulation, bundled in a CQmodel object.  The
@code{wrightMap} function can take a CQmodel object as input or it can be used
to create Wright Maps directly from data frames of person and item parameters.")

(WQS) regression, building off the @code{gWQS} package (Renzetti et al.
<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=@code{gWQS>}).  Weighted quantile sum
regression is a statistical technique to evaluate the effect of complex exposure
mixtures on an outcome (Carrico et al.  2015 <doi:10.1007/s13253-014-0180-3>).
The model features a statistical power and Type I error (i.e., false positive)
rate trade-off, as there is a machine learning step to determine the weights
that optimize the linear model fit.  This package provides an alternative method
based on a permutation test that should reliably allow for both high power and
low false positive rate when utilizing WQS regression (Day et al.  2022

     "The wavelet-based quantile mapping (WQM) technique is designed to correct biases
in spatio-temporal precipitation forecasts across multiple time scales.  The WQM
method effectively enhances forecast accuracy by generating an ensemble of
precipitation forecasts that account for uncertainties in the prediction
process.  For a comprehensive overview of the methodologies employed in this
package, please refer to Jiang, Z., and Johnson, F. (2023)
<doi:10.1029/2022EF003350>.  The package relies on two packages for continuous
wavelet transforms: @code{WaveletComp}', which can be installed automatically,
and wmtsa', which is optional and available from the CRAN archive
<https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/wmtsa/>.  Users need to manually
install wmtsa from this archive if they prefer to use wmtsa based decomposition.")

     "This package provides functions for the import, transformation, and analysis of
data from muscle physiology experiments.  The work loop technique is used to
evaluate the mechanical work and power output of muscle.  Josephson (1985)
<doi:10.1242/jeb.114.1.493> modernized the technique for application in
comparative biomechanics.  Although our initial motivation was to provide
functions to analyze work loop experiment data, as we developed the package we
incorporated the ability to analyze data from experiments that are often
complementary to work loops.  There are currently three supported experiment
types: work loops, simple twitches, and tetanus trials.  Data can be imported
directly from .ddf files or via an object constructor function.  Through either
method, data can then be cleaned or transformed via methods typically used in
studies of muscle physiology.  Data can then be analyzed to determine the timing
and magnitude of force development and relaxation (for isometric trials) or the
magnitude of work, net power, and instantaneous power among other things (for
work loops).  Although we do not provide plotting functions, all resultant
objects are designed to be friendly to visualization via either base-R plotting
or tidyverse functions.  This package has been peer-reviewed by @code{rOpenSci}

responses on an ordinal scale and may utilize a stratified design, such as
randomization within centers, to assess treatment efficacy across multiple

and adjustment for them can improve power.  The win ratio (ignores ties) and the
win odds (accounts for ties) can be useful when analyzing these types of data

functions for adjustment of the win ratio and win odds for stratification and
baseline covariates, facilitating the comparison of test and control treatments

     "Derivatives of the First-Passage Time Density and Cumulative Distribution Function, and Random Sampling from the (Truncated) First-Passage Time Distribution")
    (description
     "First, we provide functions to calculate the partial derivative of the
first-passage time diffusion probability density function (PDF) and cumulative
distribution function (CDF)	with respect to the first-passage time t (only for
PDF), the upper barrier a, the drift rate v, the relative starting point w, the
non-decision time t0, the inter-trial variability of the drift rate sv, the
inter-trial variability of the rel.  starting point sw, and the inter-trial
variability of the non-decision time st0.  In addition the PDF and CDF
themselves are also provided.  Most calculations are done on the logarithmic
scale to make it more stable.  Since the PDF, CDF, and their derivatives are
represented as infinite series, we give the user the option to control the
approximation errors with the argument precision'.  For the numerical
integration we used the C library cubature by Johnson, S. G. (2005-2013)
<https://github.com/stevengj/cubature>.  Numerical integration is required
whenever sv, sw, and/or st0 is not zero.  Note that numerical integration
reduces speed of the computation and the precision cannot be guaranteed anymore.
 Therefore, whenever numerical integration is used an estimate of the
approximation error is provided in the output list.  Note: The large number of
contributors (ctb) is due to copying a lot of C/C++ code chunks from the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL).  Second, we provide methods to sample from the
first-passage time distribution with or without user-defined truncation from
above.  The first method is a new adaptive rejection sampler building on the
works of Gilks and Wild (1992; <doi:10.2307/2347565>) and Hartmann and Klauer
(in press).  The second method is a rejection sampler provided by Drugowitsch
(2016; <doi:10.1038/srep20490>).  The third method is an inverse transformation
sampler.  The fourth method is a \"pseudo\" adaptive rejection sampler that builds
on the first method.  For more details see the corresponding help files.")

distribution of genotypes in genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) data where they expect
(by and large) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, in order to assess rates of
genotyping errors and the dependence of those rates on read depth.  It
implements a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler using Rcpp to compute a
Bayesian estimate of what we call the heterozygote miscall rate for
restriction-associated digest (RAD) sequencing data and other types of reduced
representation GBS data.  It also provides functions to generate plots of
expected and observed genotype frequencies.  Some background on these topics can
be found in a recent paper \"Recent advances in conservation and population
genomics data analysis\" by Hendricks et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/eva.12659>, and
another paper describing the MCMC approach is in preparation with Gordon Luikart

    (description
     "Inferences about counterfactuals are essential for prediction, answering what if
questions, and estimating causal effects.  However, when the counterfactuals
posed are too far from the data at hand, conclusions drawn from well-specified
statistical analyses become based largely on speculation hidden in convenient
modeling assumptions that few would be willing to defend.  Unfortunately,
standard statistical approaches assume the veracity of the model rather than
revealing the degree of model-dependence, which makes this problem hard to
detect. @code{WhatIf} offers easy-to-apply methods to evaluate counterfactuals
that do not require sensitivity testing over specified classes of models.  If an
analysis fails the tests offered here, then we know that substantive inferences
will be sensitive to at least some modeling choices that are not based on
empirical evidence, no matter what method of inference one chooses to use.
@code{WhatIf} implements the methods for evaluating counterfactuals discussed in

many objects at once.  This package contains two different implementations of
treemaps, Voronoi treemaps and Sunburst treemaps.  The Voronoi treemap function
subdivides the plot area in polygonal cells according to the highest
hierarchical level, then continues to subdivide those parental cells on the next
lower hierarchical level, and so on.  The Sunburst treemap is a computationally
less demanding treemap that does not require iterative refinement, but simply
generates circle sectors that are sized according to predefined weights.  The
Voronoi tesselation is based on functions from Paul Murrell (2012)

     "This package provides statistical methods and visualizations that are often used
in reliability engineering.  Comprises a compact and easily accessible set of
methods and visualization tools that make the examination and adjustment as well
as the analysis and interpretation of field data (and bench tests) as simple as
possible.  Non-parametric estimators like Median Ranks, Kaplan-Meier (Abernethy,
2006, <ISBN:978-0-9653062-3-2>), Johnson (Johnson, 1964, <ISBN:978-0444403223>),
and Nelson-Aalen for failure probability estimation within samples that contain
failures as well as censored data are included.  The package supports methods
like Maximum Likelihood and Rank Regression, (Genschel and Meeker, 2010,
<DOI:10.1080/08982112.2010.503447>) for the estimation of multiple parametric
lifetime distributions, as well as the computation of confidence intervals of
quantiles and probabilities using the delta method related to Fisher's
confidence intervals (Meeker and Escobar, 1998, <ISBN:9780471673279>) and the
beta-binomial confidence bounds.  If desired, mixture model analysis can be done
with segmented regression and the EM algorithm.  Besides the well-known Weibull
analysis, the package also contains Monte Carlo methods for the correction and
completion of imprecisely recorded or unknown lifetime characteristics. (Verband
der Automobilindustrie e.V. (VDA), 2016, <ISSN:0943-9412>).  Plots are created
statically ('ggplot2') or interactively ('plotly') and can be customized with
functions of the respective visualization package.  The graphical technique of
probability plotting as well as the addition of regression lines and confidence
bounds to existing plots are supported.")

     "Weather indices represent the overall weekly effect of a weather variable on
crop yield throughout the cropping season.  This package contains functions that
can convert the weekly weather data into yearly weighted Weather indices with
weights being the correlation coefficient between weekly weather data over the
years and crop yield over the years.  This can be done for an individual weather
variable and for two weather variables at a time as the interaction effect.
This method was first devised by Jain, RC, Agrawal R, and Jha, MP (1980),
\"Effect of climatic variables on rice yield and its forecast\",MAUSAM, 31(4),
591â596, <doi:10.54302/mausam.v31i4.3477>.  Later, the method have been used
by various researchers and the latest can found in Gupta, AK, Sarkar, KA,

     "Numerous time series admit autoregressive moving average (ARMA) representations,
in which the errors are uncorrelated but not necessarily independent.  These
models are called weak ARMA by opposition to the standard ARMA models, also
called strong ARMA models, in which the error terms are supposed to be
independent and identically distributed (iid).  This package allows the study of
nonlinear time series models through weak ARMA representations.  It determines
identification, estimation and validation for ARMA models and for AR and MA
models in particular.  Functions can also be used in the strong case.  This
package also works on white noises by omitting arguments p', q', ar and ma'.

options.  Furthermore, users can decide whether they wish to positively or
negatively affect the accuracy score as a result of applying weights to the
confusion matrix.  Functions are included to calculate accuracy metrics for
imbalanced data.  Finally, wconf integrates well with the caret package, but it
can also work standalone when provided data in matrix form.  References: Kuhn,

     "Assessing predictive models of spatial data can be challenging, both because
these models are typically built for extrapolating outside the original region
represented by training data and due to potential spatially structured errors,
with \"hot spots\" of higher than expected error clustered geographically due to
spatial structure in the underlying data.  Methods are provided for assessing
models fit to spatial data, including approaches for measuring the spatial
structure of model errors, assessing model predictions at multiple spatial
scales, and evaluating where predictions can be made safely.  Methods are
particularly useful for models fit using the tidymodels framework.  Methods

    (description
     "Spatial data are generally auto-correlated, meaning that if two units selected
are close to each other, then it is likely that they share the same properties.
For this reason, when sampling in the population it is often needed that the
sample is well spread over space.  A new method to draw a sample from a
population with spatial coordinates is proposed.  This method is called wave
(Weakly Associated Vectors) sampling.  It uses the less correlated vector to a
spatial weights matrix to update the inclusion probabilities vector into a
sample.  For more details see RaphaÃ«l Jauslin and Yves TillÃ© (2019)

    (description
     "The continuous wavelet transform enables the observation of
transient/non-stationary cyclicity in time-series.  The goal of
cyclostratigraphic studies is to define frequency/period in the depth/time
domain.  By conducting the continuous wavelet transform on cyclostratigraphic
data series one can observe and extract cyclic signals/signatures from signals.
These results can then be visualized and interpreted enabling one to
identify/interpret cyclicity in the geological record, which can be used to
construct astrochronological age-models and identify and interpret cyclicity in
past and present climate systems.  The @code{WaverideR} R package builds upon
existing literature and existing codebase.  The list of articles which are
relevant can be grouped in four subjects; cyclostratigraphic data
analysis,example data sets,the (continuous) wavelet transform and astronomical
solutions.  References for the cyclostratigraphic data analysis articles are:

integer powers of the mother wavelet functions.  These powers are closely
approximated by linear combinations of wavelet scaling functions at an

transform allows the posterior cumulants to be found efficiently for any data
set.  Johnson transformations then yield the credible intervals themselves.

entered in a determined format; extract specific vectors and matrices from this
raw database; normalize the input data; calculate rankings by intermediate
methods; apply the lambda parameter for the main method; and a function that
does everything at once.  The package has an example database called choppers,
with which the user can see how the input data should be organized so that
everything works as recommended by the decision methods based on multiple
criteria that this package solves.  Basically, the data are composed of a set of
alternatives, which will be ranked, a set of choice criteria, a matrix of values
for each Alternative-Criterion relationship, a vector of weights associated with
the criteria, since certain criteria are considered more important than others,
as well as a vector that defines each criterion as cost or benefit, this
determines the calculation formula, as there are those criteria that we want the
highest possible value (e.g. durability) and others that we want the lowest
possible value (e.g. price).")

The area under command is differentially owned by different individual farmers.
The Outlet runs for free of cost to irrigate the area under command 24X7.  So,
flow time of the outlet has to be divided based on an area owned by an
individual farmer and the location of his land or farm.  This roster is known as
warabandi and its generation in agriculture practices is a very tedious task.
Calculations of time in microseconds are more error-prone, especially whenever
it is performed by hands.  That division of flow time for an individual farmer
can be calculated by warabandi'.  However, it generates a full publishable
report for an outlet and all the farmers who have farms subjected to be
irrigated.  It reduces error risk and makes a more reproducible roster.  For

all subjects that have a predicted risk of x%.  A calibration plot provides a
simple, yet useful, way of assessing the calibration assumption.  The Wally plot
consists of a sequence of usual calibration plots.  Among the plots contained
within the sequence, one is the actual calibration plot which has been obtained
from the data and the others are obtained from similar simulated data under the
calibration assumption.  It provides the investigator with a direct visual
understanding of the shape and sampling variability that are common under the
calibration assumption.  The original calibration plot from the data is included
randomly among the simulated calibration plots, similarly to a police lineup.
If the original calibration plot is not easily identified then the calibration
assumption is not contradicted by the data.  The method handles the common
situations in which the data contain censored observations and occurrences of
competing events.")

variables based on weather-states (Flecher et al. (2010)
<doi:10.1029/2009WR008098>).  It uses a Markov chain for modeling the succession
of weather states.  Conditionally to the weather states, the multivariate
variables are modeled using the family of Complete Skew-Normal distributions.
Parameters are estimated on measured series.  Must include the variable Rain and
can accept as many other variables as desired.")

at several different levels of overall brightness and saturation.  Each palette
has been evaluated to ensure colors are distinguishable by colorblind people.")

package, Fernandez-Macho 2012b).  The plot outputs (heatmaps) can be displayed
in the screen or can be saved as PNG or JPG images or as PDF or EPS formats.
The W2CWM2C package also helps to handle the (input data) multivariate time
series easily as a list of N elements (times series) and provides a multivariate
data set (dataexample) to exemplify its use.  A description of the package was
published in a scientific paper: Polanco-Martinez and Fernandez-Macho (2014),
<doi:10.1109/MCSE.2014.96>.")
