provides a Bayesian approach to tackle this problem, where it exploits mixture
of point masses at zero and nonlocal priors to improve the performance of
variable selection and coefficient estimation.  product moment (pMOM) and
product inverse moment (piMOM) nonlocal priors are implemented and can be used
for the analyses.  This package performs variable selection for binary response
and survival time response datasets which are widely used in biostatistic and
bioinformatics community.  Benefiting from parallel computing ability, it
reports necessary outcomes of Bayesian variable selection such as Highest
Posterior Probability Model (HPPM), Median Probability Model (MPM) and posterior
inclusion probability for each of the covariates in the model.  The option to
use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is also part of this package that can be
exploited for predictive power measurements in real datasets.")

two groups of observations (intervention vs. control group) regarding several
prioritized endpoints to estimate the probability that a random observation
drawn from one group performs better than a random observation drawn from the
other group (Mann-Whitney parameter).  The net benefit and win ratio statistics,
i.e.  the difference and ratio between the probabilities relative to the
intervention and control groups, can then also be estimated.  Confidence
intervals and p-values are obtained based on asymptotic results (Ozenne 2021
<doi:10.1177/09622802211037067>), non-parametric bootstrap, or permutations.
The software enables the use of thresholds of minimal importance difference,
stratification, non-prioritized endpoints (O Brien test), and can handle
right-censoring and competing-risks.")

    (description
     "Statistical classification and regression have been popular among various fields
and stayed in the limelight of scientists of those fields.  Examples of the
fields include clinical trials where the statistical classification of patients
is indispensable to predict the clinical courses of diseases.  Considering the
negative impact of diseases on performing daily tasks, correctly classifying
patients based on the clinical information is vital in that we need to identify
patients of the high-risk group to develop a severe state and arrange medical
treatment for them at an opportune moment.  Deep learning - a part of artificial
intelligence - has gained much attention, and research on it burgeons during
past decades: see, e.g, Kazemi and Mirroshandel (2018)
<DOI:10.1016/j.artmed.2017.12.001>.  It is a veritable technique which was
originally designed for the classification, and hence, the Buddle package can
provide sublime solutions to various challenging classification and regression
problems encountered in the clinical trials.  The Buddle package is based on the
back-propagation algorithm - together with various powerful techniques such as
batch normalization and dropout - which performs a multi-layer feed-forward
neural network: see Krizhevsky et.  al (2017) <DOI:10.1145/3065386>, Schmidhuber
(2015) <DOI:10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003> and LeCun et al. (1998)
<DOI:10.1109/5.726791> for more details.  This package contains two main
functions: TrainBuddle() and FetchBuddle().  TrainBuddle() builds a feed-forward
neural network model and trains the model.  FetchBuddle() recalls the trained
model which is the output of TrainBuddle(), classifies or regresses given data,
and make a final prediction for the data.")

functions can be differentiated and integrated to obtain B-splines calculating
derivatives/integrals at any point.  B-splines of this package can
simultaneously operate on a series of curves sharing the same set of knots.

     "Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL, Price et al. (2018)
<doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302882>) is an alternative to standard,
non-parametric approximate Bayesian computation (ABC).  BSL assumes a
multivariate normal distribution for the summary statistic likelihood and it is
suitable when the distribution of the model summary statistics is sufficiently
regular.  This package provides a Metropolis Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo
implementation of four methods (BSL, uBSL, semiBSL and BSLmisspec) and two
shrinkage estimators (graphical lasso and Warton's estimator).  uBSL (Price et
al. (2018) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1302882>) uses an unbiased estimator to
the normal density.  A semi-parametric version of BSL (semiBSL, An et al. (2018)
<arXiv:1809.05800>) is more robust to non-normal summary statistics.  BSLmisspec
(Frazier et al.  2019 <arXiv:1904.04551>) estimates the Gaussian synthetic
likelihood whilst acknowledging that there may be incompatibility between the
model and the observed summary statistic.  Shrinkage estimation can help to
decrease the number of model simulations when the dimension of the summary
statistic is high (e.g., BSLasso, An et al. (2019)
<doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1537928>).  Extensions to this package are planned.

estimation of scale reliability may not be trustworthy.  A recommended solution
for this common problem has been Bayesian model estimation.  Bayesian methods
rely on user specified information from historical data or researcher intuition
to more accurately estimate the parameters.  This package provides a user
friendly interface for estimating test reliability.  Here, reliability is
modeled as a beta distributed random variable with shape parameters alpha=true
score variance and beta=error variance (Tanzer & Harlow, 2020)

longitudinal data.  It builds upon the tidy time series data frames used in the
tsibble package, and is designed to integrate within the tidyverse', and
tidyverts (for time series) ecosystems.  The methods implemented include
calculating features for understanding longitudinal data, including calculating
summary statistics such as quantiles, medians, and numeric ranges, sampling
individual series, identifying individual series representative of a group, and
extending the facet system in ggplot2 to facilitate exploration of samples of
data.  These methods are fully described in the paper \"brolgar: An R package to

    (synopsis "Broken Stick Model for Irregular Longitudinal Data")
    (description
     "Data on multiple individuals through time are often sampled at times that differ
between persons.  Irregular observation times can severely complicate the
statistical analysis of the data.  The broken stick model approximates each
subjectâs trajectory by one or more connected line segments.  The times at
which segments connect (breakpoints) are identical for all subjects and under
control of the user.  A well-fitting broken stick model effectively transforms
individual measurements made at irregular times into regular trajectories with
common observation times.  Specification of the model requires just three
variables: time, measurement and subject.  The model is a special case of the
linear mixed model, with time as a linear B-spline and subject as the grouping
factor.  The main assumptions are: subjects are exchangeable, trajectories
between consecutive breakpoints are straight, random effects follow a
multivariate normal distribution, and unobserved data are missing at random.
The package contains functions for fitting the broken stick model to data, for
predicting curves in new data and for plotting broken stick estimates.  The
package supports two optimization methods, and includes options to structure the
variance-covariance matrix of the random effects.  The analyst may use the
software to smooth growth curves by a series of connected straight lines, to
align irregularly observed curves to a common time grid, to create synthetic
curves at a user-specified set of breakpoints, to estimate the time-to-time
correlation matrix and to predict future observations.  For additional
documentation on background, methodology and applications see
<https://growthcharts.org/brokenstick/articles/manual/manual.html>.")

     "Computation of BRINDA Adjusted Micronutrient Biomarkers for Inflammation")
    (description
     "Inflammation can affect many micronutrient biomarkers and can thus lead to
incorrect diagnosis of individuals and to over- or under-estimate the prevalence
of deficiency in a population.  Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and
Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) is a multi-agency and multi-country
partnership designed to improve the interpretation of nutrient biomarkers in
settings of inflammation and to generate context-specific estimates of risk
factors for anemia (Suchdev (2016) <doi:10.3945/an.115.010215>).  In the past
few years, BRINDA published a series of papers to provide guidance on how to
adjust micronutrient biomarkers, retinol binding protein, serum retinol, serum
ferritin by Namaste (2020), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), serum zinc,
serum and Red Blood Cell (RBC) folate, and serum B-12, using inflammation
markers, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and/or C-Reactive Protein (CRP) by
Namaste (2020) <doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqaa141>, Rohner (2017)
<doi:10.3945/ajcn.116.142232>, McDonald (2020) <doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqz304>, and
Young (2020) <doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqz303>.  The BRINDA inflammation adjustment
method mainly focuses on Women of Reproductive Age (WRA) and Preschool-age
Children (PSC); however, the general principle of the BRINDA method might apply
to other population groups.  The BRINDA R package is a user-friendly all-in-one
R package that uses a series of functions to implement BRINDA adjustment method,
as described above.  The BRINDA R package will first carry out rigorous checks
and provides users guidance to correct data or input errors (if they occur)
prior to inflammation adjustments.  After no errors are detected, the package
implements the BRINDA inflammation adjustment for up to five micronutrient
biomarkers, namely retinol-binding-protein, serum retinol, serum ferritin, sTfR,
and serum zinc (when appropriate), using inflammation indicators of AGP and/or
CRP for various population groups.  Of note, adjustment for serum and RBC folate
and serum B-12 is not included in the R package, since evidence shows that no
adjustment is needed for these micronutrient biomarkers in either WRA or PSC
groups (Young (2020) <doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqz303>).")

equations in Firth (1993) <doi:10.1093/biomet/80.1.27> and Kosmidis and Firth
(2009) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asp055>, or the median bias-reduction adjusted score
equations in Kenne et al. (2017) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asx046>, or through the
direct subtraction of an estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood
estimator from the maximum likelihood estimates as in Cordeiro and McCullagh
(1991) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592>.  See Kosmidis et al (2020)
<doi:10.1007/s11222-019-09860-6> for more details.  Estimation in all cases
takes place via a quasi Fisher scoring algorithm, and S3 methods for the
construction of of confidence intervals for the reduced-bias estimates are
provided.  In the special case of generalized linear models for binomial and
multinomial responses (both ordinal and nominal), the adjusted score approaches
to mean and media bias reduction have been found to return estimates with
improved frequentist properties, that are also always finite, even in cases
where the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete and
quasi-complete separation; see Kosmidis and Firth, 2020

    (description
     "Forecasters predicting the chances of a future event may disagree due to
differing evidence or noise.  To harness the collective evidence of the crowd,
Ville SatopÃ¤Ã¤ (2021) \"Regularized Aggregation of One-off Probability
Predictions\" <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3769945>
proposes a Bayesian aggregator that is regularized by analyzing the forecasters
disagreement and ascribing over-dispersion to noise.  This aggregator requires
no user intervention and can be computed efficiently even for a large numbers of
predictions.  The author evaluates the aggregator on subjective probability
predictions collected during a four-year forecasting tournament sponsored by the
US intelligence community.  The aggregator improves the accuracy of simple
averaging by around 20% and other state-of-the-art aggregators by 10-25%.  The
advantage stems almost exclusively from improved calibration.  This aggregator
-- know as \"the revealed aggregator\" -- inputs a) forecasters probability
predictions (p) of a future binary event and b) the forecasters common prior
(p0) of the future event.  In this R-package, the function
sample_aggregator(p,p0,...) allows the user to calculate the revealed
aggregator.  Its use is illustrated with a simple example.")

Microbiome data is compositional, meaning that the total abundance of each
sample sums to 1, and this introduces severe statistical distortions.  This
method takes a Bayesian approach to correcting for these statistical
distortions, in which the total abundance is treated as an unknown variable.

(labeled OR2 model) is estimated using Gibbs sampling only.  For each model
framework, there is a specific function for estimation.  The summary output
produces estimates for regression quantiles and two measures of model comparison

     "Best Orthogonalized Subset Selection (BOSS) is a least-squares (LS) based subset
selection method, that performs best subset selection upon an orthogonalized
basis of ordered predictors, with the computational effort of a single ordinary
LS fit.  This package provides a highly optimized implementation of BOSS and
estimates a heuristic degrees of freedom for BOSS, which can be plugged into an
information criterion (IC) such as AICc in order to select the subset from
candidates.  It provides various choices of IC, including AIC, BIC, AICc, Cp and
GCV. It also implements the forward stepwise selection (FS) with no additional
computational cost, where the subset of FS is selected via cross-validation
(CV).  CV is also an option for BOSS. For details see: Tian, Hurvich and
Simonoff (2021), \"On the Use of Information Criteria for Subset Selection in
Least Squares Regression\", <arXiv:1911.10191>.")

modeling longitudinal response using multivariate tree base learners.
Longitudinal response could be continuous, binary, nominal or ordinal.  A
time-covariate interaction effect is modeled using penalized B-splines
(P-splines) with estimated adaptive smoothing parameter.  Although the package
is design for longitudinal data, it can handle cross-sectional data as well.

corresponding to Gaussian, Student T, probit, logit, SVM, and a few others.
Spike and slab regression is Bayesian regression with prior distributions
containing a point mass at zero.  The posterior updates the amount of mass on
this point, leading to a posterior distribution that is actually sparse, in the
sense that if you sample from it many coefficients are actually zeros.  Sampling
from this posterior distribution is an elegant way to handle Bayesian variable
selection and model averaging.  See <DOI:10.1504/IJMMNO.2014.059942> for an
explanation of the Gaussian case.")

    (description
     "The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I clinical trial
design for finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  It can be used to design
both single-agent and drug-combination trials.  The BOIN design is motivated by
the top priority and concern of clinicians when testing a new drug, which is to
effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing them to
subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses.  The prominent advantage of the BOIN
design is that it achieves simplicity and superior performance at the same time.
 The BOIN design is algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple way
similar to the traditional 3+3 design.  The BOIN design yields an average
performance that is comparable to that of the continual reassessment method
(CRM, one of the best model-based designs) in terms of selecting the MTD, but
has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly
toxic doses.  For tutorial, please check Yan et al. (2020)

     "This project aims to enable the method of Path Analysis to infer causalities
from data.  For this we propose a hybrid approach, which uses Bayesian network
structure learning algorithms from data to create the input file for creation of
a PA model.  The process is performed in a semi-automatic way by our
intermediate algorithm, allowing novice researchers to create and evaluate their
own PA models from a data set.  The references used for this project are:

characterize discovered clusters.  Prior network knowledge (e.g., public
interaction databases) can be included via blacklisting and penalization
matrices.  For clustering, the EM algorithm is employed.  For structure search
at the M-step, the Bayesian approach is used.  The output includes membership
assignments of samples, cluster-specific MAP networks, and posterior
probabilities of all edges in the discovered networks.  In addition to
likelihood, AIC and BIC scores are returned.  They can be used for choosing the

     "The Bayesian Markov renewal mixed models take sequentially observed categorical
data with continuous duration times, being either state duration or inter-state
duration.  These models comprehensively analyze the stochastic dynamics of both
state transitions and duration times under the influence of multiple exogenous
factors and random individual effect.  The default setting flexibly models the
transition probabilities using Dirichlet mixtures and the duration times using
gamma mixtures.  It also provides the flexibility of modeling the categorical
sequences using Bayesian Markov mixed models alone, either ignoring the duration
times altogether or dividing duration time into multiples of an additional
category in the sequence by a user-specific unit.  The package allows extensive
inference of the state transition probabilities and the duration times as well
as relevant plots and graphs.  It also includes a synthetic data set to
demonstrate the desired format of input data set and the utility of various
functions.  Methods for Bayesian Markov renewal mixed models are as described

    (description
     "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a highly versatile analytical technique for
studying molecular configuration, conformation, and dynamics, especially those
of biomacromolecules such as proteins.  Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank
('BMRB') is a repository for Data from NMR Spectroscopy on Proteins, Peptides,
Nucleic Acids, and other Biomolecules.  Currently, BMRB offers an R package
RBMRB to fetch data, however, it doesn't easily offer individual data file
downloading and storing in a local directory.  When using RBMRB', the data will
stored as an R object, which fundamentally hinders the NMR researches to access
the rich information from raw data, for example, the metadata.  Here, BMRBr File
Downloader ('BMRBr') offers a more fundamental, low level downloader, which will
download original deposited .str format file.  This type of file contains
information such as entry title, authors, citation, protein sequences, and so
on.  Many factors affect NMR experiment outputs, such as temperature, resonance
sensitivity and etc., approximately 40% of the entries in the BMRB have chemical
shift accuracy problems [1,2] Unfortunately, current reference correction
methods are heavily dependent on the availability of assigned protein chemical
shifts or protein structure.  This is my current research project is going to
solve, which will be included in the future release of the package.  The current
version of the package is sufficient and robust enough for downloading
individual BMRB data file from the BMRB database <http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu>.
The functionalities of this package includes but not limited: * To simplifies
NMR researches by combine data downloading and results analysis together. * To
allows NMR data reaches a broader audience that could utilize more than just
chemical shifts but also metadata. * To offer reference corrected data for
entries without assignment or structure information (future release).

whose latent space coordinates are close.  The package is mainly based on the
model by Hoff, Raftery and Handcock (2002) <doi:10.1198/016214502388618906> and
contains some extra features (e.g., removal of the Procrustean step, weights
implemented as coefficients of the latent distances, 3D plots).  The original
code related to the above model was retrieved from

design is optimized sequentially with the levels of each successive block factor
optimized conditional on all previously optimized block factors.  D-optimality
is used throughout except for square or rectangular lattice block designs which
are constructed algebraically using mutually orthogonal Latin squares.  Crossed
block designs with interaction effects are optimized using a weighting scheme
which allows for differential weighting of first and second-order block effects.

tables showing the achieved D-efficiency factors for each block and treatment
design.  Edmondson, R.N. Multi-level Block Designs for Comparative Experiments.

tailored to the prediction of binary, survival and continuous outcomes using
block-structured covariate data, for example, clinical covariates plus
measurements of a certain omics data type or multi-omics data, that is, data for
which measurements of different types of omics data and/or clinical data for
each patient exist.  Examples of different omics data types include gene
expression measurements, mutation data and copy number variation measurements.
Block forest are presented in Hornung & Wright (2019).  The package includes
four other random forest variants for multi-omics data: RandomBlock',
BlockVarSel', VarProb', and SplitWeights'.  These were also considered in
Hornung & Wright (2019), but performed worse than block forest in their
comparison study based on 20 real multi-omics data sets.  Therefore, we
recommend to use block forest ('BlockForest') in applications.  The other random
forest variants can, however, be consulted for academic purposes, for example,
in the context of further methodological developments.  Reference: Hornung, R. &

    (description
     "Assess the agreement in method comparison studies by tolerance intervals and
errors-in-variables (EIV) regressions.  The Ordinary Least Square regressions
(OLSv and OLSh), the Deming Regression (DR), and the (Correlated)-Bivariate
Least Square regressions (BLS and CBLS) can be used with unreplicated or
replicated data.  The BLS() and CBLS() are the two main functions to estimate a
regression line, while XY.plot() and MD.plot() are the two main graphical
functions to display, respectively an (X,Y) plot or (M,D) plot with the BLS or
CBLS results.  Four hyperbolic statistical intervals are provided: the
Confidence Interval (CI), the Confidence Bands (CB), the Prediction Interval and
the Generalized prediction Interval.  Assuming no proportional bias, the (M,D)
plot (Band-Altman plot) may be simplified by calculating univariate tolerance
intervals (beta-expectation (type I) or beta-gamma content (type II)).  Major
updates from last version 1.0.0 are: title shortened, include the new functions
BLS.fit() and CBLS.fit() as shortcut of the, respectively, functions BLS() and
CBLS().  References: B.G. Francq, B. Govaerts (2016) <doi:10.1002/sim.6872>,

deterministic solutions, bioPN creates the associated system of differential
equations \"on the fly\", and solves it with a Runge Kutta Dormand Prince 45
explicit algorithm.  For stochastic solutions, bioPN offers variants of
Gillespie algorithm, or SSA. For hybrid deterministic/stochastic, it employs the
Haseltine and Rawlings algorithm, that partitions the system in fast and slow
reactions.  bioPN algorithms are developed in C to achieve adequate performance.")

original algorithm is an extension of the k-nearest neighbors method proposed by
Bertsimas et al. (2017) (<https://jmlr.org/papers/v18/17-073.html>) using a
bi-objective approach.  A brief description of the method can be found in
Cubillos (2021) (<https://pure.au.dk/portal/files/214627979/biokNN.pdf>).  The
biokNN package provides an R implementation of the method for datasets with
continuous variables (e.g. employee productivity, student grades) and a
categorical class variable (e.g. department, school).  Given an incomplete
dataset with such structure, this package produces complete datasets using both
single and multiple imputation, including visualization tools to better
understand the pattern of the missing values.")

biogeom includes several real data sets of the boundary coordinates of natural

Cumulative biogas and methane production (and rates) can be calculated using
volumetric, manometric, gravimetric, or gas density methods for any number of
bottles.  With cumulative methane production data and data on bottle contents,
biochemical methane potential (BMP) can be calculated and summarized, including
subtraction of the inoculum contribution and normalization by substrate mass.
Cumulative production and production rates can be summarized in several
different ways (e.g., omitting normalization) using the same function.  Biogas
quantity and composition can be predicted from substrate composition and
additional, optional data.  Lastly, inoculum and substrate mass can be
determined for planning BMP experiments.")

underlying processes that enable forecasters and forecasting methods to improve,
decomposing forecasting accuracy into three components: bias, partial
information, and noise.  By describing the differences between two groups of
forecasters, the model allows the user to carry out useful inference, such as
calculating the posterior probabilities of the treatment reducing bias,
diminishing noise, or increasing information.  It also provides insight into how
much tamping down bias and noise in judgment or enhancing the efficient
extraction of valid information from the environment improves forecasting
accuracy.  This package provides easy access to the BIN model.  For further

methods maintain the areas specified by the binned data. (Equivalently, all CDF
smoothing methods interpolate the points specified by the binned data.) In
practice, an estimate for the mean of the distribution should be supplied as an
optional argument.  Doing so greatly improves the reliability of statistics
computed from the smoothed density functions.  Includes methods for estimating
the Gini coefficient, the Theil index, percentiles, and random deviates from a
smoothed distribution.  Among the three methods, the optimized spline
(splinebins) is recommended for most purposes.  The percentile and random-draw
methods should be regarded as experimental, and these methods only support

non-parametric method, termed the bounded midpoint estimator (BME), which
assigns cases to their bin midpoints; except for the censored bins, where cases
are assigned to an income estimated by fitting a Pareto distribution.  Because
the usual Pareto estimate can be inaccurate or undefined, especially in small
samples, we implement a bounded Pareto estimate that yields much better results.
 We also provide a parametric approach, which fits distributions from the
generalized beta (GB) family.  Because some GB distributions can have poor fit
or undefined estimates, we fit 10 GB-family distributions and use multimodel
inference to obtain definite estimates from the best-fitting distributions.  We
also provide binned income data from all United States of America school

     "Estimate the correlation between two irregular time series that are not
necessarily sampled on identical time points.  This program is also applicable
to the situation of two evenly spaced time series that are not on the same time
grid.  BINCOR is based on a novel estimation approach proposed by Mudelsee
(2010, 2014) to estimate the correlation between two climate time series with
different timescales.  The idea is that autocorrelation (AR1 process) allows to
correlate values obtained on different time points.  BINCOR contains four
functions: bin_cor() (the main function to build the binned time series),
plot_ts() (to plot and compare the irregular and binned time series, cor_ts()
(to estimate the correlation between the binned time series) and ccf_ts() (to
estimate the cross-correlation between the binned time series).")

integrated completed likelihood (ICL) and the Bayesian integrated likelihood
(BIC).  Finally, the co-clustering adjusted Rand index (CARI) to measure
agreement between co-clustering partitions is implemented.  Robert Valerie,

Divide-and-conquer MDS proposed by Delicado P. and C. PachÃ³n-GarcÃ­a (2021)
<arXiv:2007.11919>. - Interpolation MDS, also proposed by Delicado P. and C.
PachÃ³n-GarcÃ­a (2021) <arXiv:2007.11919>, which uses Gower's interpolation
formula as described in Gower, J. C. and D. J. Hand (1995). - Fast MDS, which is
an implementation of the algorithm proposed by Yang, T., J. Liu, L. McMillan,
and W. Wang (2006).  The main idea of these algorithms is based on partitioning
the data set into small pieces, where classical methods can work.  In order to
align all the solutions, Procrustes formula is used as described in Borg, I. and
P. Groenen (2005).")

     "Implementation of a collection of MCMC methods for Bayesian structure learning
of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), both from continuous and discrete data.  For
efficient inference on larger DAGs, the space of DAGs is pruned according to the
data.  To filter the search space, the algorithm employs a hybrid approach,
combining constraint-based learning with search and score.  A reduced search
space is initially defined on the basis of a skeleton obtained by means of the
PC-algorithm, and then iteratively improved with search and score.  Search and
score is then performed following two approaches: Order MCMC, or Partition MCMC.
The BGe score is implemented for continuous data and the BDe score is
implemented for binary data or categorical data.  The algorithms may provide the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) graph or a sample (a collection of DAGs) from the
posterior distribution given the data.  All algorithms are also applicable for
structure learning and sampling for dynamic Bayesian networks.  References: J.

techniques in frequent pattern mining and estimation statistics.  Given a set of
individual vectors S={x} where x(i) is a realization value of binary variable i,
the framework infers empirical causal relations of binary variables i,j from S
in a form of causal graph G=(V,E) where V is a set of nodes representing binary
variables and there is an edge from i to j in E if the variable i causes j.  The
framework determines dependency among variables as well as analyzing confounding
factors before deciding whether i causes j.  The publication of this package is

     "This package provides functions for the evaluation of basket trial designs with
binary endpoints.  Operating characteristics of a basket trial design are
assessed by simulating trial data according to scenarios, analyzing the data
with Bayesian hierarchical models (BHMs), and assessing decision probabilities
on stratum and trial-level based on Go / No-go decision making.  The package is
build for high flexibility regarding decision rules, number of interim analyses,
number of strata, and recruitment.  The BHMs proposed by Berry et al. (2013)
<doi:10.1177/1740774513497539> and Neuenschwander et al. (2016)
<doi:10.1002/pst.1730>, as well as a model that combines both approaches are
implemented.  Functions are provided to implement Bayesian decision rules as for
example proposed by Fisch et al. (2015) <doi:10.1177/2168479014533970>.  In
addition, posterior point estimates (mean/median) and credible intervals for
response rates and some model parameters can be calculated.  For simulated trial
data, bias and mean squared errors of posterior point estimates for response
rates can be provided.")

have to solve four data-based puzzles to find the login and password.  There are
many ways to solve these puzzles.  You may use loops, data filtering, ordering,
aggregation or other tools.  Only basics knowledge of R is required to play the
game, yet the more functions you know, the more approaches you can try.  In
frequon you will help to perform statistical cryptanalytic attack on a corpus of
ciphered messages.  This time seven sub-tasks are pushing the bar much higher.
Do you accept the challenge? In regression you will test your modeling skills in
a series of eight sub-tasks.  Try only if ANOVA is your close friend.  It's a

    (description
     "This package provides a class of Bayesian beta regression models for the
analysis of continuous data with support restricted to an unknown finite
support.  The response variable is modeled using a four-parameter beta
distribution with the mean or mode parameter depending linearly on covariates
through a link function.  When the response support is known to be (0,1), the
above class of models reduce to traditional (0,1) supported beta regression
models.  Model choice is carried out via the logarithm of the pseudo marginal
likelihood (LPML), the deviance information criterion (DIC), and the
Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC).  See Zhou and Huang (2022)

normalization combines a rank-mapping approach with a shifted logit
approximation that allows the transformation to work on data outside the
original domain.  It is also able to handle new data within the original domain
via linear interpolation.  The package is built to estimate the best normalizing
transformation for a vector consistently and accurately.  It implements the
Box-Cox transformation, the Yeo-Johnson transformation, three types of Lambert
WxF transformations, and the ordered quantile normalization transformation.  It
estimates the normalization efficacy of other commonly used transformations, and
it allows users to specify custom transformations or normalization statistics.
Finally, functionality can be integrated into a machine learning workflow via
recipes.")

used as stand-alone functions.  The bent cable (linear-quadratic-linear)
generalizes the broken stick (linear-linear), which is also handled by this
package.  Version 0.2 corrected a glitch in the computation of confidence
intervals for the CTP. References that were updated from Versions 0.2.1 and
0.2.2 appear in Version 0.2.3 and up.  Version 0.3.0 improved robustness of the
error-message producing mechanism.  Version 0.3.1 improves the NAMESPACE file of
the package.  It is the author's intention to distribute any future updates via
GitHub.")

and fdh+), and using different efficiency measures (input based, output based,
hyperbolic graph, additive, super, and directional efficiency).  Peers and
slacks are available, partial price information can be included, and optimal
cost, revenue and profit can be calculated.  Evaluation of mergers is also
supported.  Methods for graphing the technology sets are also included.  There
is also support for comparative methods based on Stochastic Frontier Analyses
(SFA) and for convex nonparametric least squares of convex functions (STONED).
In general, the methods can be used to solve not only standard models, but also
many other model variants.  It complements the book, Bogetoft and Otto,
Benchmarking with DEA, SFA, and R, Springer-Verlag, 2011, but can of course also
be used as a stand-alone package.")

    (description
     "An interface for the Neo4j database providing mapping between different
identifiers of biological entities.  This Biological Entity Dictionary (BED) has
been developed to address three main challenges.  The first one is related to
the completeness of identifier mappings.  Indeed, direct mapping information
provided by the different systems are not always complete and can be enriched by
mappings provided by other resources.  More interestingly, direct mappings not
identified by any of these resources can be indirectly inferred by using
mappings to a third reference.  For example, many human Ensembl gene ID are not
directly mapped to any Entrez gene ID but such mappings can be inferred using
respective mappings to HGNC ID. The second challenge is related to the mapping
of deprecated identifiers.  Indeed, entity identifiers can change from one
resource release to another.  The identifier history is provided by some
resources, such as Ensembl or the NCBI, but it is generally not used by mapping
tools.  The third challenge is related to the automation of the mapping process
according to the relationships between the biological entities of interest.
Indeed, mapping between gene and protein ID scopes should not be done the same
way than between two scopes regarding gene ID. Also, converting identifiers from
different organisms should be possible using gene orthologs information.  A
ready to use database is provided as a Docker image

The unknown mean of the data generating process is modelled as a piecewise
linear function of time with an unknown number of change-points.  The package
infers the joint posterior distribution of the number and position of
change-points as well as the unknown mean parameters per time-series by MCMC
sampling.  A-priori, the proposed model uses an overfitting number of mean
parameters but, conditionally on a set of change-points, only a subset of them
influences the likelihood.  An exponentially decreasing prior distribution on
the number of change-points gives rise to a posterior distribution concentrating
on sparse representations of the underlying sequence, but also available is the
Poisson distribution.  See Papastamoulis et al (2017) <arXiv:1709.06111> for a

health care decisions for an individual patient or a group of patients.
Nevertheless, it remains challenging to evaluate HTE based on information
collected from clinical studies that are often designed and conducted to
evaluate the efficacy of a treatment for the overall population.  The Bayesian
framework offers a principled and flexible approach to estimate and compare
treatment effects across subgroups of patients defined by their characteristics.
 This package allows users to explore a wide range of Bayesian HTE analysis
models, and produce posterior inferences about HTE. See Wang et al. (2018)

cleaning, parsing, and harmonization of scientific names from several taxonomic
groups against taxonomic databases locally stored through the application of
exact and partial matching algorithms; 4) Space: flagging of erroneous, suspect,
and low-precision geographic coordinates; and 5) Time: flagging and, whenever
possible, correction of inconsistent collection date.  In addition, it contains
features to visualize, document, and report data quality â which is essential

challenges, we develop a novel clustering method in the Bayesian setting.  This
method, called BCSub, adopts an innovative semiparametric Bayesian factor
analysis model to reduce the dimension of the data to a few factor scores for
clustering.  Specifically, the factor scores are assumed to follow the Dirichlet
process mixture model in order to induce clustering.")

longitudinal gene expression data.  BClustLonG is a package that allows us to
perform clustering analysis for longitudinal gene expression data.  It adopts a
linear-mixed effects framework to model the trajectory of genes over time, while
clustering is jointly conducted based on the regression coefficients obtained
from all genes.  To account for the correlations among genes and alleviate the
high dimensionality challenges, factor analysis models are adopted for the
regression coefficients.  The Dirichlet process prior distribution is utilized
for the means of the regression coefficients to induce clustering.  This package
allows users to specify which variables to use for clustering (intercepts or
slopes or both) and whether a factor analysis model is desired.  More details
about this method can be found in Jiehuan Sun, et al. (2017)

    (description
     "The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a long-running program that
seeks to monitor the status and trends of the breeding birds in North America.
Since its start in 1966, the BBS has accumulated over 50 years of data for over
500 species of North American Birds.  Given the temporal and spatial structure
of the data, hierarchical Bayesian models are used to assess the status and
trends of these 500+ species of birds.  bbsBayes allows you to perform
hierarchical Bayesian analysis of BBS data.  You can run a full model analysis
for one or more species that you choose, or you can take more control and
specify how the data should be stratified, prepared for JAGS', or modelled.  The
functions provided here allow you to replicate analyses performed by the United
State Geological Survey (USGS, see Link and Sauer (2011)
<doi:10.1525/auk.2010.09220>) and Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS, see Smith and
Edwards (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.03.26.010215>).")

formal Bayesian answer to testing and variable selection problems.  From a
theoretical side, the emphasis in this package is placed on the prior
distributions and it allows a wide range of them: Jeffreys (1961); Zellner and
Siow(1980)<DOI:10.1007/bf02888369>; Zellner and Siow(1984); Zellner

(2012)<DOI:10.1214/12-aos1013>.  The interaction with the package is through a
friendly interface that syntactically mimics the well-known lm() command of R.
The resulting objects can be easily explored providing the user very valuable
information (like marginal, joint and conditional inclusion probabilities of
potential variables; the highest posterior probability model, HPM; the median
probability model, MPM) about the structure of the true -data generating- model.
 Additionally, this package incorporates abilities to handle problems with a
large number of potential explanatory variables through parallel and heuristic
versions of the main commands, Garcia-Donato and Martinez-Beneito
(2013)<DOI:10.1080/01621459.2012.742443>.  It also allows problems with p>n and

with factors.")

have a Markovian dependence structure.  A function, PlotBayesSurv(), is provided
to easily create plots of the posterior means of the hazard, cumulative hazard
and survival function, with a credible band accompanying the latter two.  The
priors and samplers are described in more detail in Castillo and Van der Pas
(2020) \"Multiscale Bayesian survival analysis\" <arXiv:2005.02889>.  In that
paper it is also shown that the credible bands for the survival function and the
cumulative hazard can be considered confidence bands (under mild conditions) and
thus offer reliable uncertainty quantification.")

multidimensional tests: omega_t (total) and omega_h (hierarchical).  The results
include confidence and credible intervals, the probability of a coefficient
being larger than a cutoff, and a check for the factor models, necessary for the
omega coefficients.  The method for the Bayesian unidimensional estimates,
except for omega_u, is sampling from the posterior inverse Wishart for the
covariance matrix based measures (see Murphy', 2007,
<https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/papers/murphy-2007.pdf>.  The
Bayesian omegas (u, t, and h) are obtained by Gibbs sampling from the
conditional posterior distributions of (1) the single factor model and (2) the
second-order factor model ('Lee', 2007,
<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470024737>).")

random effects model with application to multivariate meta-analysis.  The
posterior for the model parameters, namely the overall mean vector and the
between-study covariance matrix, are assessed by constructing Markov chains
based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithms as developed in Bodnar and Bodnar
(2021) (<arXiv:2104.02105>).  The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is designed
under the assumption of the normal distribution and the t-distribution when the
Berger and Bernardo reference prior and the Jeffreys prior are assigned to the
model parameters.  Convergence properties of the generated Markov chains are
investigated by the rank plots and the split hat-R estimate based on the rank
normalization, which are proposed in Vehtari et al. (2021)

<doi:10.1007/s11222-014-9500-2>).  The number of mixture components does not
have to be specified; it is estimated simultaneously with the mixture weights
and components through the SFM approach.  Second, the resulting MCMC output is
used to calculate the number of modes and their locations following Basturk,
Hoogerheide and van Dijk (2021) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3783351>.  Posterior
probabilities are retrieved for both of these quantities providing a powerful
tool for mode inference.  Currently the package supports a flexible mixture of

factor analysis is a dimension reduction tool for multivariate time series.
bayesdfa extends conventional dynamic factor models in several ways.  First,
extreme events may be estimated in the latent trend by modeling process error
with a student-t distribution.  Second, alternative constraints (including
proportions are allowed).  Third, the estimated dynamic factors can be analyzed
with hidden Markov models to evaluate support for latent regimes.")

    (description
     "This package provides a set of functions to help clinical trial researchers
calculate power and sample size for two-arm Bayesian randomized clinical trials
that do or do not incorporate historical control data.  At some point during the
design process, a clinical trial researcher who is designing a basic two-arm
Bayesian randomized clinical trial needs to make decisions about power and
sample size within the context of hypothesized treatment effects.  Through
simulation, the simple_sim() function will estimate power and other user
specified clinical trial characteristics at user specified sample sizes given
user defined scenarios about treatment effect,control group characteristics, and
outcome.  If the clinical trial researcher has access to historical control
data, then the researcher can design a two-arm Bayesian randomized clinical
trial that incorporates the historical data.  In such a case, the researcher
needs to work through the potential consequences of historical and randomized
control differences on trial characteristics, in addition to working through
issues regarding power in the context of sample size, treatment effect size, and
outcome.  If a researcher designs a clinical trial that will incorporate
historical control data, the researcher needs the randomized controls to be from
the same population as the historical controls.  What if this is not the case
when the designed trial is implemented? During the design phase, the researcher
needs to investigate the negative effects of possible historic/randomized
control differences on power, type one error, and other trial characteristics.
Using this information, the researcher should design the trial to mitigate these
negative effects.  Through simulation, the historic_sim() function will estimate
power and other user specified clinical trial characteristics at user specified
sample sizes given user defined scenarios about historical and randomized
control differences as well as treatment effects and outcomes.  The results from
historic_sim() and simple_sim() can be printed with print_table() and graphed
with plot_table() methods.  Outcomes considered are Gaussian, Poisson,
Bernoulli, Lognormal, Weibull, and Piecewise Exponential.  The methods are
described in Eggleston et al. (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v100.i21>.")

    (description
     "Implementation of multisource exchangeability models for Bayesian analyses of
prespecified subgroups arising in the context of basket trial design and
monitoring.  The R basket package facilitates implementation of the binary,
symmetric multi-source exchangeability model (MEM) with posterior inference
arising from both exact computation and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
Analysis output includes full posterior samples as well as posterior
probabilities, highest posterior density (HPD) interval boundaries, effective
sample sizes (ESS), mean and median estimations, posterior exchangeability
probability matrices, and maximum a posteriori MEMs. In addition to providing
\"basketwise\" analyses, the package includes similar calculations for
\"clusterwise\" analyses for which subgroups are combined into meta-baskets, or
clusters, using graphical clustering algorithms that treat the posterior
exchangeability probabilities as edge weights.  In addition plotting tools are
provided to visualize basket and cluster densities as well as their
exchangeability.  References include Hyman, D.M., Puzanov, I., Subbiah, V.,

    (description
     "Tool to perform Bayesian inference of carcass processing/transport strategy and
bone attrition from archaeofaunal skeletal profiles characterized by percentages
of MAU (Minimum Anatomical Units).  The approach is based on a generative model
for skeletal profiles that replicates the two phases of formation of any faunal
assemblage: initial accumulation as a function of human transport strategies and
subsequent attrition.Two parameters define this model: 1) the transport
preference (alpha), which can take any value between - 1 (mostly axial
contribution) and 1 (mostly appendicular contribution) following strategies
constructed as a function of butchering efficiency of different anatomical
elements and the results of ethnographic studies, and 2) degree of attrition
(beta), which can vary between 0 (no attrition) and 10 (maximum attrition) and
relates the survivorship of bone elements to their maximum bone density.
Starting from uniform prior probability distribution functions of alpha and
beta, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling based on a random walk
Metropolis-Hasting algorithm is adopted to derive the posterior probability
distribution functions, which are then available for interpretation.  During
this process, the likelihood of obtaining the observed percentages of MAU given
a pair of parameter values is estimated by the inverse of the Chi2 statistic,
multiplied by the proportion of elements within a 1 percent of the observed
value.  See Ana B. Marin-Arroyo, David Ocio

     "Package for Bayesian Variable Selection and Model Averaging in linear models and
generalized linear models using stochastic or deterministic sampling without
replacement from posterior distributions.  Prior distributions on coefficients
are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors corresponding to the
Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008)
<DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337> for linear models or mixtures of g-priors from
Li and Clyde (2019) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1469992> in generalized linear
models.  Other model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes
estimates of g.  Sampling probabilities may be updated based on the sampled
models using sampling w/out replacement or an efficient MCMC algorithm which
samples models using a tree structure of the model space as an efficient hash
table.  See Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049> for
details on the sampling algorithms.  Uniform priors over all models or
beta-binomial prior distributions on model size are allowed, and for large p
truncated priors on the model space may be used to enforce sampling models that
are full rank.  The user may force variables to always be included in addition
to imposing constraints that higher order interactions are included only if
their parents are included in the model.  This material is based upon work

(Hernandez B, Raftery A.E., Parnell A.C. (2018) <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9767-1>)
is an extension to the original BART sum-of-trees model (Chipman et al 2010).
BART-BMA differs to the original BART model in two main aspects in order to
implement a greedy model which will be computationally feasible for high
dimensional data.  Firstly BART-BMA uses a greedy search for the best split
points and variables when growing decision trees within each sum-of-trees model.
 This means trees are only grown based on the most predictive set of split
rules.  Also rather than using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BART-BMA uses a
greedy implementation of Bayesian Model Averaging called Occam's Window which
take a weighted average over multiple sum-of-trees models to form its overall
prediction.  This means that only the set of sum-of-trees for which there is
high support from the data are saved to memory and used in the final model.")

discrepancies between training and test sets in prediction scenarios.  Moreover,
addon quantile normalization and addon RMA normalization (Kostka & Spang, 2008)
is implemented to enable integrating the quantile normalization step into
prediction rules.  The following batch effect removal methods are implemented:
FAbatch, ComBat, (f)SVA, mean-centering, standardization, Ratio-A and Ratio-G.
For each of these we provide an additional function which enables a posteriori
('addon') batch effect removal in independent batches ('test data').  Here, the
(already batch effect adjusted) training data is not altered.  For evaluating
the success of batch effect adjustment several metrics are provided.  Moreover,
the package implements a plot for the visualization of batch effects using
principal component analysis.  The main functions of the package for batch
effect adjustment are ba() and baaddon() which enable batch effect removal and
addon batch effect removal, respectively, with one of the seven methods
mentioned above.  Another important function here is bametric() which is a
wrapper function for all implemented methods for evaluating the success of batch
effect removal.  For (addon) quantile normalization and (addon) RMA
normalization the functions qunormtrain(), qunormaddon(), rmatrain() and
rmaaddon() can be used.")

normal response, t response, Binomial (Bernoulli) response, Poisson response,
ordered multinomial response and multinomial response variables.  All models
accommodate unobserved heterogeneity by including a normal distribution of the
parameters across individuals.  Outputs of the package include tables of sums of
squares, effect sizes and p-values, and tables of predictions, which are easily
interpretable for behavioral and social researchers.  The floodlight analysis
and mediation analysis based on these models are also provided.  BANOVA uses
Stan and JAGS as the computational platform.  References: Dong and Wedel (2017)

    (description
     "Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) is a practical methodology that aims to
estimate the area of distribution of a species.  However, most of the work has
focused on estimating static expressions of the correlation between
environmental variables.  The outputs of correlative species distribution models
can be interpreted as maps of the suitable environment for a species but not
generally as maps of its actual distribution.  SoberÃ³n and Peterson (2005)
<doi:10.17161/bi.v2i0.4> presented the BAM scheme, a heuristic framework that
states that the occupied area of a species occurs on sites that have been
accessible through dispersal (M) and have both favorable biotic (B) and abiotic
conditions (A).  The bamm package implements classes and functions to operate on
each element of the BAM and by using a cellular automata model where the
occupied area of a species at time t is estimated by the multiplication of three
binary matrices: one matrix represents movements (M), another abiotic -niche-
tolerances (A), and a third, biotic interactions (B).  The theoretical
background of the package can be found in SoberÃ³n and Osorio-Olvera (2022)
<arXiv:2212.06308>.")

nucleotide recoding RNA-seq experiments (NR-seq; TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq,
TUC-seq, etc.) for analyzing and comparing NR-seq datasets (see Vock and Simon
(2022) <doi:10.1101/2022.09.02.505697>).  NR-seq is a powerful extension of
RNA-seq that provides information about the kinetics of RNA metabolism (e.g.,
RNA degradation rate constants), which is notably lacking in standard RNA-seq
data.  The statistical model makes maximal use of these high-throughput datasets
by sharing information across transcripts to significantly improve uncertainty
quantification and increase statistical power.  bakR includes a maximally
efficient implementation of this model for conservative initial investigations
of datasets.  bakR also provides more highly powered implementations using the
probabilistic programming language Stan to sample from the full posterior
distribution.  bakR performs multiple-test adjusted statistical inference with
the output of these model implementations to help biologists separate signal
from background.  Methods to automatically visualize key results and detect
batch effects are also provided.")

probability of correct go/no-go decision at interim look.  The evaluation can be
presented numerically or graphically.  Users need to have JAGS 4.0.0 or newer
