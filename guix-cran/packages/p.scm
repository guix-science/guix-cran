    (synopsis "Create Longitudinal Google Trends Data")
    (description
     "Google Trends provides cross-sectional and time-series data on searches, but
lacks readily available longitudinal data.  Researchers, who want to create
longitudinal Google Trends on their own, face practical challenges, such as
normalized counts that make it difficult to combine cross-sectional and
time-series data and limitations in data formats and timelines that limit data
granularity over extended time periods.  This package addresses these issues and
enables researchers to generate longitudinal Google Trends data.  This package
is built on pytrends', a Python library that acts as the unofficial Google
Trends API to collect Google Trends data.  As long as the Google Trends API',
pytrends and all their dependencies are working, this package will work.  During
testing, we noticed that for the same input (keyword, topic, data_format,
timeline), the output index can vary from time to time.  Besides, if the keyword
is not very popular, then the resulting dataset will contain a lot of zeros,
which will greatly affect the final result.  While this package has no control
over the accuracy or quality of Google Trends data, once the data is created,
this package coverts it to longitudinal data.  In addition, the user may
encounter a 429 Too Many Requests error when using @code{cross_section()} and
@code{time_series()} to collect Google Trends data.  This error indicates that
the user has exceeded the rate limits set by the Google Trends API'.  For more
information about the Google Trends API - pytrends', visit
<https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/>.")

    (description
     "Computing Average and TPX Power under various BHFDR type sequential procedures.
All of these procedures involve control of some summary of the distribution of
the FDP, e.g. the proportion of discoveries which are false in a given
experiment.  The most widely known of these, the BH-FDR procedure, controls the
FDR which is the mean of the FDP. A lesser known procedure, due to Lehmann and
Romano, controls the FDX, or probability that the FDP exceeds a user provided
threshold.  This is less conservative than FWE control procedures but much more
conservative than the BH-FDR proceudre.  This package and the references
supporting it introduce a new procedure for controlling the FDX which we call
the BH-FDX procedure.  This procedure iteratively identifies, given alpha and
lower threshold delta, an alpha* less than alpha at which BH-FDR guarantees FDX
control.  This uses asymptotic approximation and is only slightly more
conservative than the BH-FDR procedure.  Likewise, we can think of the power in
multiple testing experiments in terms of a summary of the distribution of the
True Positive Proportion (TPP), the portion of tests truly non-null distributed
that are called significant.  The package will compute power, sample size or any
other missing parameter required for power defined as (i) the mean of the TPP
(average power) or (ii) the probability that the TPP exceeds a given value,
lambda, (TPX power) via asymptotic approximation.  All supplied theoretical
results are also obtainable via simulation.  The suggested approach is to narrow
in on a design via the theoretical approaches and then make final
adjustments/verify the results by simulation.  The theoretical results are
described in Izmirlian, G (2020) Statistics and Probability letters,
\"<doi:10.1016/j.spl.2020.108713>\", and an applied paper describing the
methodology with a simulation study is in preparation.  See

parameters of a stochastic state space model (i.e.  a model where a time series
is observed with error).  The goal of this package is to estimate the
variability around a deterministic process, both in terms of observation error -
i.e.  variability due to imperfect observations that does not influence system
state - and in terms of process noise - i.e.  stochastic variation in the actual
state of the process.  Unlike classical methods for estimating variability, this
package does not necessarily assume that the deterministic state is fixed (i.e.
a fixed-point equilibrium), meaning that variability around a dynamic trajectory
can be estimated (e.g. stochastic fluctuations during predator-prey dynamics).")

analyze data from the sulfoxidation database @code{MetOSite}'.  Utilities to
search and characterize S-aromatic motifs in proteins are also provided.  In
addition, functions to analyze sequence environments around modifiable residues
in proteins can be found.  For instance, ptm allows to search for amino acids
either overrepresented or avoided around the modifiable residues from the
proteins of interest.  Functions tailored to test statistical hypothesis related
to these differential sequence environments are also implemented.  Further and

visualization of the propensity score distribution in both treatment groups with
mirror histogram, (2) covariate balance diagnosis, (3) propensity score model
specification test, (4) weighted estimation of treatment effect, and (5)
augmented estimation of treatment effect with outcome regression.  The weighting
methods include the inverse probability weight (IPW) for estimating the average
treatment effect (ATE), the IPW for average treatment effect of the treated
(ATT), the IPW for the average treatment effect of the controls (ATC), the
matching weight (MW), the overlap weight (OVERLAP), and the trapezoidal weight

with these models: visualization tools, functions for sequence prediction and
artificial sequences generation, as well as for context and pattern mining.  The
package is specifically adapted to the field of social sciences by allowing to
learn VLMC models from sets of individual sequences possibly containing missing
values, and by accounting for case weights.  The library also allows to compute
probabilistic divergence between two models, and to fit segmented VLMC, where
sub-models fitted to distinct strata of the learning sample are stored in a
single PST. This software results from research work executed within the
framework of the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research LIVES, which is
financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.  The authors are grateful to

Biostatistics, 21(3): 545-560 <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy074>.  The methods
avoid the restrictive placebo structural risk modeling assumption common to past
methods and further improve robustness by the use of nonparametric kernel
smoothing for biomarker density estimation.  A randomized controlled two-group
clinical efficacy trial is assumed with an ordered categorical or continuous
univariate biomarker response measured at a fixed timepoint post-randomization
and with a univariate baseline surrogate measure allowed to be observed in only
a subset of trial participants with an observed biomarker response (see the
flexible three-phase sampling design in the paper for details).  Bootstrap-based

     "Pooling, backward and forward selection of linear, logistic and Cox regression
models in multiply imputed datasets.  Backward and forward selection can be done
from the pooled model using Rubin's Rules (RR), the D1, D2, D3, D4 and the
median p-values method.  This is also possible for Mixed models.  The models can
contain continuous, dichotomous, categorical and restricted cubic spline
predictors and interaction terms between	all these type of predictors.  The
stability of the models	can be evaluated using (cluster) bootstrapping.  The
package further contains functions to pool model performance measures as
ROC/AUC, Reclassification, R-squared, scaled Brier score, H&L test and
calibration	plots for logistic regression models.  Internal validation can be
done across multiply imputed datasets with cross-validation or bootstrapping.
The adjusted intercept after shrinkage of pooled regression coefficients can be
obtained.  Backward and forward selection as part of internal validation is
possible.  A function to externally validate logistic prediction models in
multiple imputed datasets is available and a function to compare models.  For
Cox models a strata variable can be included.  Eekhout (2017)

    (description
     "Bayesian dynamic borrowing is an approach to incorporating external data to
supplement a randomized, controlled trial analysis in which external data are
incorporated in a dynamic way (e.g., based on similarity of outcomes); see Viele
2013 <doi:10.1002/pst.1589> for an overview.  This package implements the
hierarchical commensurate prior approach to dynamic borrowing as described in
Hobbes 2011 <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01564.x>.  There are three main
functionalities.  First, psborrow2 provides a user-friendly interface for
applying dynamic borrowing on the study results handles the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo sampling on behalf of the user.  Second, psborrow2 provides a simulation
framework to compare different borrowing parameters (e.g. full borrowing, no
borrowing, dynamic borrowing) and other trial and borrowing characteristics
(e.g. sample size, covariates) in a unified way.  Third, psborrow2 provides a
set of functions to generate data for simulation studies, and also allows the
user to specify their own data generation process.  This package is designed to
use the sampling functions from cmdstanr which can be installed from
<https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev>.")

    (description
     "Hybrid control design is a way to borrow information from external controls to
augment concurrent controls in a randomized controlled trial and is expected to
overcome the feasibility issue when adequate randomized controlled trials cannot
be conducted.  A major challenge in the hybrid control design is its inability
to eliminate a prior-data conflict caused by systematic imbalances in measured
or unmeasured confounding factors between patients in the concurrent
treatment/control group and external controls.  To prevent the prior-data
conflict, a combined use of propensity score matching and Bayesian commensurate
prior has been proposed in the context of hybrid control design.  The propensity
score matching is first performed to guarantee the balance in baseline
characteristics, and then the Bayesian commensurate prior is constructed while
discounting the information based on the similarity in outcomes between the
concurrent and external controls. @code{psBayesborrow} is a package to implement
the propensity score matching and the Bayesian analysis with commensurate prior,
as well as to conduct a simulation study to assess operating characteristics of
the hybrid control design, where users can choose design parameters in flexible
and straightforward ways depending on their own application.")

    (description
     "This package provides a simulation framework to simulate streamflow time series
with similar main characteristics as observed data.  These characteristics
include the distribution of daily streamflow values and their temporal
correlation as expressed by short- and long-range dependence.  The approach is
based on the randomization of the phases of the Fourier transform or the phases
of the wavelet transform.  The function @code{prsim()} is applicable to single
site simulation and uses the Fourier transform.  The function
@code{prsim.wave()} extends the approach to multiple sites and is based on the
complex wavelet transform.  The function @code{prsim.weather()} extends the
approach to multiple variables for weather generation.  We further use the
flexible four-parameter Kappa distribution, which allows for the extrapolation
to yet unobserved low and high flows.  Alternatively, the empirical or any other
distribution can be used.  A detailed description of the simulation approach for
single sites and an application example can be found in Brunner et al. (2019)

wavelet-based multi-site approach can be found in Brunner and Gilleland (2020)

interpretation of large datasets in sedimentary geology.  Includes functionality
for adaptive kernel density estimation, principal component analysis,
correspondence analysis, multidimensional scaling, generalised procrustes
analysis and individual differences scaling using a variety of dissimilarity
measures.  Univariate provenance proxies, such as single-grain ages or
(isotopic) compositions are compared with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper,
Wasserstein-2 or Sircombe-Hazelton L2 distances.  Categorical provenance proxies
such as chemical compositions are compared with the Aitchison and Bray-Curtis
distances,and count data with the chi-square distance.  Varietal data can either
be converted to one or more distributional datasets, or directly compared using
the multivariate Wasserstein distance.  Also included are tools to plot
compositional and count data on ternary diagrams and point-counting data on
radial plots, to calculate the sample size required for specified levels of
statistical precision, and to assess the effects of hydraulic sorting on
detrital compositions.  Includes an intuitive query-based user interface for
users who are not proficient in R.")

    (description
     "In a typical protein labelling procedure, proteins are chemically tagged with a
functional group, usually at specific sites, then digested into peptides, which
are then analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to generate peptide fingerprint.
Relative to the control, peptides that are heavier by the mass of the labelling
group are informative for sequence determination.  Searching for peptides with
such mass shifts, however, can be difficult.  This package, designed to tackle
this inconvenience, takes as input the mass list of two or multiple MALDI-TOF MS
mass lists, and makes pairwise comparisons between the labeled groups vs.
control, and restores centroid mass spectra with highlighted peaks of interest
for easier visual examination.  Particularly, peaks differentiated by the mass
of the labelling group are defined as a âpairâ, those with equal masses as a
âmatchâ, and all the other peaks as a âmismatchâ.For more bioanalytical
background information, refer to following publications: Jingjing Deng (2015)

    (description
     "This package provides a reliable and flexible toolbox to score patient-reported
outcome (PRO), Quality of Life (QOL), and other psychometric measures.  The
guiding philosophy is that scoring errors can be eliminated by using a limited
number of well-tested, well-behaved functions to score PRO-like measures.  The
workhorse of the package is the @code{scoreScale} function, which can be used to
score most single-scale measures.  It can reverse code items that need to be
reversed before scoring and pro-rate scores for missing item data.  Currently,
three different types of scores can be output: summed item scores, mean item
scores, and scores scaled to range from 0 to 100.  The PR@code{OscorerTools}
functions can be used to write new functions that score more complex measures.
In fact, PR@code{OscorerTools} functions are the building blocks of the scoring
functions in the PROscorer package (which is a repository of functions that
score specific commonly-used instruments).  Users are encouraged to use
PR@code{OscorerTools} to write scoring functions for their favorite PRO-like
instruments, and to submit these functions for inclusion in PROscorer (a
tutorial vignette will be added soon).  The long-term vision for the
PR@code{OscorerTools} and PROscorer packages is to provide an easy-to-use system
to facilitate the incorporation of PRO measures into research studies in a
scientifically rigorous and reproducible manner.  These packages and their
vignettes are intended to help establish and promote \"best practices\" for
scoring and describing PRO-like measures in research.")

method is proposed here.  The two-dimensional scatter plot of any projection
method can construct a topographic map which displays unapparent data structures
by using distance and density information of the data.  The generalized
U*-matrix renders this visualization in the form of a topographic map, which can
be used to automatically define the clusters of high-dimensional data.  The
whole system is based on Thrun and Ultsch, \"Using Projection based Clustering to
Find Distance and Density based Clusters in High-Dimensional Data\"
<DOI:10.1007/s00357-020-09373-2>.  Selecting the correct projection method will
result in a visualization in which mountains surround each cluster.  The number
of clusters can be determined by counting valleys on the topographic map.  Most
projection methods are wrappers for already available methods in R. By contrast,
the neighbor retrieval visualizer (@code{NeRV}) is based on C++ source code of
the dredviz software package, and the Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA) is
translated from MATLAB ('SOM Toolbox 2.0) to R.")

comparison.  All indices can also be decomposed into different components,
providing insightful information on the sources of productivity and
profitability changes.  In the use of Malmquist productivity index, the
technological change index can be further decomposed into bias technological
change components.  The package also allows to prohibit technological regression
(negative technological change).  In the case of the Fisher, Hicks-Moorsteen,
Laspeyres, Paasche and the transitive FÃ¤re-Primont and Lowe indices, it is
furthermore possible to rule out technological change.  Deflated shadow prices
can also be obtained.  Besides, the package allows parallel computing as an
option, depending on the user's computer configuration.  All computations are
carried out with the nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and several
assumptions regarding returns to scale are available.  All DEA linear programs
are implemented using lp_solve'.")

sampling procedure, instead of having the sampling procedure generate them.  In
Lindblom (2014) <doi:10.2478/jos-2014-0047>, and therein cited papers, it is
shown how this is carried out and how it improves the estimates.  This package
supports two common fixed-size sampling procedures (simple random sampling and
probability-proportional-to-size sampling) and includes a function for
transforming the PRN's in order to control the sample overlap.")

The package includes a linear congruence map as the decision map and three
chaotic maps to generate the pseudo-random sequence, which follow a uniform
distribution.  Other distributions can be generated from the uniform
distribution using the Inversion Principle Method and BOX-Muller transformation.
 Small perturbations in seed values result in entirely different sequences of
numbers due to the sensitive nature of the maps being used.  The chaotic nature
of the maps helps achieve randomness in the generator.  Additionally, the
generator is capable of producing random bits.")

    (description
     "Miscellaneous printing of numeric or statistical results in R Markdown or Quarto
documents according to guidelines of the \"Publication Manual\" of the American
Psychological Association (2020, ISBN: 978-1-4338-3215-4).  These guidelines are
usually referred to as APA style (<https://apastyle.apa.org/>) and include
specific rules on the formatting of numbers and statistical test results.  APA
style has to be implemented when submitting scientific reports in a wide range
of research fields, especially in the social sciences.  The default output of
numbers in the R console or R Markdown and Quarto documents does not meet the
APA style requirements, and reformatting results manually can be cumbersome and
error-prone.  This package covers the automatic conversion of R objects to
textual representations that meet the APA style requirements, which can be
included in R Markdown or Quarto documents.  It covers some basic statistical
tests (t-test, ANOVA, correlation, chi-squared test, Wilcoxon test) as well as
some basic number printing manipulations (formatting p-values, removing leading
zeros for numbers that cannot be greater than one, and others).  Other packages
exist for formatting numbers and tests according to the APA style guidelines,
such as papaja (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=papaja>) and apa
(<https://cran.r-project.org/package=apa>), but they do not offer all
convenience functionality included in prmisc'.  The vignette has an overview of
most of the functions included in the package.")

     "Systematic conservation prioritization using mixed integer linear programming
(MILP).  It provides a flexible interface for building and solving conservation
planning problems.  Once built, conservation planning problems can be solved
using a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers.  By using
exact algorithm solvers, solutions can be generated that are guaranteed to be
optimal (or within a pre-specified optimality gap).  Furthermore, conservation
problems can be constructed to optimize the spatial allocation of different
management actions or zones, meaning that conservation practitioners can
identify solutions that benefit multiple stakeholders.  To solve large-scale or
complex conservation planning problems, users should install the Gurobi
optimization software (available from <https://www.gurobi.com/>) and the gurobi
R package (see Gurobi Installation Guide vignette for details).  Users can also
install the IBM CPLEX software
(<https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/cplex-optimizer>)
and the @code{cplexAPI} R package (available at
<https://github.com/cran/@code{cplexAPI>}).  Additionally, the rcbc R package

The function @code{PrInDT()} represents the basic resampling loop for 2-class
classification (cf.  Weihs & Buschfeld, 2021a).  The function @code{RePrInDT()}
(repeated @code{PrInDT()}) allows for repeated applications of @code{PrInDT()}
for different percentages of the observations of the large and the small classes
(cf.  Weihs & Buschfeld, 2021c).  The function @code{NesPrInDT()} (nested
@code{PrInDT()}) allows for an extra layer of subsampling for a specific factor
variable (cf.  Weihs & Buschfeld, 2021b).  The functions @code{PrInDTMulev()}
and @code{PrInDTMulab()} deal with multilevel and multilabel classification.  In
addition to these @code{PrInDT()} variants for classification, the function
@code{PrInDTreg()} has been developed for regression problems.  Finally, the
function @code{PostPrInDT()} allows for a posterior analysis of the distribution
of a specified variable in the terminal nodes of a given tree.  References are:

     "This is a computational package designed to identify the most sensitive
interactions within a network which must be estimated most accurately in order
to produce qualitatively robust predictions to a press perturbation.  This is
accomplished by enumerating the number of sign switches (and their magnitude) in
the net effects matrix when an edge experiences uncertainty.  The package
produces data and visualizations when uncertainty is associated to one or more
edges in the network and according to a variety of distributions.  The software
requires the network to be described by a system of differential equations but
only requires as input a numerical Jacobian matrix evaluated at an equilibrium
point.  This package is based on Koslicki, D., & Novak, M. (2017)

through the use of a parametric family of binary regression curves, such as
logit, probit or cauchit.  The additive logistic regression model and
nonparametric regression are also alternatives which have been implemented.  The
idea behind the presmoothed landmark estimators is to use the presmoothing
techniques developed by Cao et al. (2005) <doi:10.1007/s00180-007-0076-6> in the

    (description
     "Multi-state models are essential tools in longitudinal data analysis.  One
primary goal of these models is the estimation of transition probabilities, a
critical metric for predicting clinical prognosis across various stages of
diseases or medical conditions.  Traditionally, inference in multi-state models
relies on the Aalen-Johansen (AJ) estimator which is consistent under the Markov
assumption.  However, in many practical applications, the Markovian nature of
the process is often not guaranteed, limiting the applicability of the AJ
estimator in more complex scenarios.  This package extends the landmark
Aalen-Johansen estimator (Putter, H, Spitoni, C (2018)
<doi:10.1177/0962280216674497>) incorporating presmoothing techniques described
by Soutinho, Meira-Machado and Oliveira (2020)
<doi:10.1080/03610918.2020.1762895>, offering a robust alternative for
estimating transition probabilities in non-Markovian multi-state models with
multiple states and potential reversible transitions.")

are replicated at each environment.  A collection of several utility functions
related to p-Rep designs have been developed.  Here, the package contains six
functions for a complete stepwise analytical study of these designs.  Five
functions @code{pRep1()}, @code{pRep2()}, @code{pRep3()}, @code{pRep4()} and
@code{pRep5()}, are used to generate five new series of p-Rep designs and also
compute average variance factors and canonical efficiency factors of generated
designs.  A fourth function @code{NCEV()} is used to generate incidence matrix
(N), information matrix (C), canonical efficiency factor (E) and average
variance factor (V).  This function is general in nature and can be used for
studying the characterization properties of any block design.  A construction
procedure for p-Rep designs was given by Williams et al.(2011)

    (description
     "Prepares data for statistical analysis (e.g., analysis of variance ;ANOVA) by
enabling the user to easily and quickly merge (using the @code{file_merge()}
function) raw data files into one merged table and then aggregate the merged
table (using the @code{prep()} function) into a finalized table while keeping
track and summarizing every step of the preparation.  The finalized table
contains several possibilities for dependent measures of the dependent variable.
 Most suitable when measuring variables in an interval or ratio scale (e.g.,
reaction-times) and/or discrete values such as accuracy.  Main functions
included are @code{file_merge()} and @code{prep()}.  The @code{file_merge()}
function vertically merges individual data files (in a long format) in which
each line is a single observation to one single dataset.  The @code{prep()}
function aggregates the single dataset according to any combination of grouping
variables (i.e., between-subjects and within-subjects independent variables,
respectively), and returns a data frame with a number of dependent measures for
further analysis for each cell according to the combination of provided grouping
variables.  Dependent measures for each cell include among others means before
and after rejecting all values according to a flexible standard deviation
criteria, number of rejected values according to the flexible standard deviation
criteria, proportions of rejected values according to the flexible standard
deviation criteria, number of values before rejection, means after rejecting
values according to procedures described in Van Selst & Jolicoeur (1994;
suitable when measuring reaction-times), standard deviations, medians, means
according to any percentile (e.g., 0.05, 0.25, 0.75, 0.95) and harmonic means.
The data frame @code{prep()} returns can also be exported as a txt file to be
used for statistical analysis in other statistical programs.")

     "Bayesian clustering using a Dirichlet process mixture model.  This model is an
alternative to regression models, non-parametrically linking a response vector
to covariate data through cluster membership.  The package allows Bernoulli,
Binomial, Poisson, Normal, survival and categorical response, as well as Normal
and discrete covariates.  It also allows for fixed effects in the response
model, where a spatial CAR (conditional autoregressive) term can be also
included.  Additionally, predictions may be made for the response, and missing
values for the covariates are handled.  Several samplers and label switching
moves are implemented along with diagnostic tools to assess convergence.  A
number of R functions for post-processing of the output are also provided.  In
addition to fitting mixtures, it may additionally be of interest to determine
which covariates actively drive the mixture components.  This is implemented in
the package as variable selection.  The main reference for the package is

(IDI).  Also included are functions to create plots, such as risk distributions,
ROC curves, calibration plot, discrimination box plot and predictiveness curves.
 In addition to functions to assess the performance of risk models, the package
includes functions to obtain weighted and unweighted risk scores as well as
predicted risks using logistic regression analysis.  These logistic regression
functions are specifically written for models that include genetic variables,
but they can also be applied to models that are based on non-genetic risk

One algorithm is based on quadratic penalty and difference convex method.
Another algorithm is based on difference convex and ADMM, called DC-ADD, which
is more efficient.  Generalized cross validation and stability based method were
provided to select the tuning parameters.  Rand index, adjusted Rand index and

    (description
     "This package allows users to calculate the number of under-five child deaths
caused by consumption of poor quality antimalarials across 39 sub-Saharan
nations.  The package supports one function, that starts an interactive web tool
created using the shiny R package.  The web tool runs locally on the user's
machine.  The web tool allows users to set input parameters (prevalence of poor
quality antimalarials, case fatality rate of children who take poor quality
antimalarials, and sample size) which are then used to perform an uncertainty
analysis following the Latin hypercube sampling scheme.  Users can download the
output figures as PDFs, and the output data as CSVs.  Users can also download
their input parameters for reference.  This package was designed to accompany
the analysis presented in: J. Patrick Renschler, Kelsey Walters, Paul Newton,
Ramanan Laxminarayan \"Estimated under-five deaths associated with poor-quality
antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa\", 2014.  Paper submitted.")

     "Stochastic block model used for dynamic graphs represented by Poisson processes.
 To model recurrent interaction events in continuous time, an extension of the
stochastic block model is proposed where every individual belongs to a latent
group and interactions between two individuals follow a conditional
inhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity driven by the individualsâ latent
groups.  The model is shown to be identifiable and its estimation is based on a
semiparametric variational expectation-maximization algorithm.  Two versions of
the method are developed, using either a nonparametric histogram approach (with
an adaptive choice of the partition size) or kernel intensity estimators.  The
number of latent groups can be selected by an integrated classification
likelihood criterion.  Y. Baraud and L. BirgÃ© (2009).

Power analysis is in the context of estimating the LATE (also known as the
complier average causal effect, or CACE), with calculations based on a test of
the null hypothesis that the LATE equals 0 with a two-sided alternative.  The
method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power
under minimal assumptions.  Package allows users to recover power, sample size
requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes.  Package also allows users to
work with absolute effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional
assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate adjustment.")

for mcmc.list objects.  These objects can be used to store output from models
fitted with Bayesian inference using JAGS', @code{WinBUGS}', @code{OpenBUGS}',
NIMBLE', Stan', or even custom MCMC algorithms.  Although the coda R package
provides some methods for these objects, it is somewhat limited in easily
performing post-processing tasks for specific nodes.  Models are ever increasing
in their complexity and the number of tracked nodes, and oftentimes a user may
wish to summarize/diagnose sampling behavior for only a small subset of nodes at
a time for a particular question or figure.  Thus, many postpack functions
support performing tasks on a subset of nodes, where the subset is specified
with regular expressions.  The functions in postpack streamline the extraction,
summarization, and diagnostics of specific monitored nodes after model fitting.
Further, because there is rarely only ever one model under consideration,
postpack scales efficiently to perform the same tasks on output from multiple
models simultaneously, facilitating rapid assessment of model sensitivity to
changes in assumptions.")

concentration parameter is an effective sample size parameter, determining the
faith we have in the model versus the data.  When the concentration is low, the
samples are close to the exact Bayesian logistic regression method; when the
concentration is high, the samples are close to the simplified variational Bayes
logistic regression.  The method is described in full in the paper Lyddon,

Each portfolio design is easily defined as a function that takes as input a
window of the stock prices and outputs the portfolio weights.  Multiple
portfolios can be easily specified as a list of functions or as files in a
folder.  Multiple datasets can be conveniently extracted randomly from different
markets, different time periods, and different subsets of the stock universe.
The results can be later assessed and ranked with tables based on a number of
performance criteria (e.g., expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, drawdown,
turnover rate, return on investment, computational time, etc.), as well as
plotted in a number of ways with nice barplots and boxplots.")

    (description
     "The name of the package is derived from the French, pour ridge, and provides
functionality for ridge-type estimation of a potpourri of models.  Currently,
this estimation concerns that of various Gaussian graphical models from
different study designs.  Among others it considers the regular Gaussian
graphical model and a mixture of such models.  The porridge-package implements
the estimation of the former either from i) data with replicated observations by
penalized loglikelihood maximization using the regular ridge penalty on the
parameters (van Wieringen, Chen, 2021) or ii) from non-replicated data by means
of either a ridge estimator with multiple shrinkage targets (as presented in van
Wieringen et al.  2020, <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2020.104621>) or the generalized
ridge estimator that allows for both the inclusion of quantitative and
qualitative prior information on the precision matrix via element-wise
penalization and shrinkage (van Wieringen, 2019,
<doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1604374>).  Additionally, the porridge-package
facilitates the ridge penalized estimation of a mixture of Gaussian graphical
models (Aflakparast et al., 2018).  On another note, the package also includes
functionality for ridge-type estimation of the generalized linear model (as
presented in van Wieringen, Binder, 2022, <doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2035231>).")

target toxicity rates and cohort sizes.  The @code{PoP} design has desirable
properties, such as coherence and consistency.  Moreover, the @code{PoP} design
provides better empirical performance than the BOIN and Keyboard design with
respect to high average probabilities of choosing the MTD and slightly lower

samples.  The primary application is for estimating prevalence of a marker in a
population based on the results of tests on pooled specimens.  This sampling
method is often employed in surveillance of rare conditions in humans or animals
(e.g. molecular xenomonitoring).  The package was initially conceived as an
R-based alternative to the molecular xenomonitoring software, @code{PoolScreen}
<https://sites.uab.edu/statgenetics/software/>.  However, it goes further,
allowing for estimates of prevalence to be adjusted for hierarchical sampling
frames, and perform flexible mixed-effect regression analyses (@code{McLure} et
al.  Environmental Modelling and Software. <DOI:10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105158>).
 The package is currently in early stages, however more features are planned or
in the works: e.g. adjustments for imperfect test specificity/sensitivity,
functions for helping with optimal experimental design, and functions for
spatial modelling.")

     "Pool dilution is a isotope tracer technique wherein a biogeochemical pool is
artifically enriched with its heavy isotopologue and the gross productive and
consumptive fluxes of that pool are quantified by the change in pool size and
isotopic composition over time.  This package calculates gross production and
consumption rates from closed-system isotopic pool dilution time series data.
Pool size concentrations and heavy isotope (e.g., 15N) content are measured over
time and the model optimizes production rate (P) and the first order rate
constant (k) by minimizing error in the model-predicted total pool size, as well
as the isotopic signature.  The model optimizes rates by weighting information
against the signal:noise ratio of concentration and heavy- isotope signatures
using measurement precision as well as the magnitude of change over time.  The
calculations used here are based on von Fischer and Hedin (2002)

    (description
     "This package provides a collection of tools to handle microsatellite data of any
ploidy (and samples of mixed ploidy) where allele copy number is not known in
partially heterozygous genotypes.  It can import and export data in ABI
@code{GeneMapper}', Structure', ATetra', Tetrasat'/'Tetra', @code{GenoDive}',
SPA@code{GeDi}', POPDIST', STRand', and binary presence/absence formats.  It can
calculate pairwise distances between individuals using a stepwise mutation model
or infinite alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and allele
frequencies into account.  These distances can be used for the calculation of
clonal diversity statistics or used for further analysis in R. Allelic diversity
statistics and Polymorphic Information Content are also available.  polysat can
assist the user in estimating the ploidy of samples, and it can estimate allele
frequencies in populations, calculate pairwise or global differentiation
statistics based on those frequencies, and export allele frequencies to
SPA@code{GeDi} and adegenet'.  Functions are also included for assigning alleles
to isoloci in cases where one pair of microsatellite primers amplifies alleles
from two or more independently segregating isoloci.  polysat is described by
Clark and Jasieniuk (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.02985.x> and Clark and

particular practical application of the polycross method occurs in the
production of a synthetic variety resulting from cross-pollinated plants.
Laying out these experiments in appropriate designs, known as polycross designs,
would not only save experimental resources but also gather more information from
the experiment.  Different experimental situations may arise in polycross
nurseries which may be requiring different polycross designs (Varghese et.  al.

     "Integrated species distribution modeling is a rising field in quantitative
ecology thanks to significant rises in the quantity of data available, increases
in computational speed and the proven benefits of using such models.  Despite
this, the general software to help ecologists construct such models in an
easy-to-use framework is lacking.  We therefore introduce the R package
@code{PointedSDMs}': which provides the tools to help ecologists set up
integrated models and perform inference on them.  There are also functions
within the package to help run spatial cross-validation for model selection, as
well as generic plotting and predicting functions.  An introduction to these
methods is discussed in Issac, Jarzyna, Keil, Dambly, Boersch-Supan, Browning,

via the pattern-oriented modeling (POM) approach (Grimm et al.,2005,
<doi:10.1126/science.1116681>).  The package includes classes for encapsulating
and generating model parameters, and managing the POM workflow.  The workflow
includes: model setup; generating model parameters via Latin hyper-cube sampling
(Iman & Conover, 1980, <doi:10.1080/03610928008827996>); running multiple
sampled model simulations; collating summary results; and validating and
selecting an ensemble of models that best match known patterns.  By default,
model validation and selection utilizes an approximate Bayesian computation
(ABC) approach (Beaumont et al., 2002, <doi:10.1093/genetics/162.4.2025>),
although alternative user-defined functionality could be employed.  The package
includes a spatially explicit demographic population model simulation engine,
which incorporates default functionality for density dependence, correlated
environmental stochasticity, stage-based transitions, and distance-based
dispersal.  The user may customize the simulator by defining functionality for
translocations, harvesting, mortality, and other processes, as well as defining
the sequence order for the simulator processes.  The framework could also be
adapted for use with other model simulators by utilizing its extendable
(inheritable) base classes.")

to reduce the mathematical and machine errors.  Designed for compatibility with
the @code{numDeriv} package, which has not received updates in several years, it
introduces advanced features such as computing derivatives of arbitrary order,
improving the accuracy of Hessian approximations by avoiding repeated
differencing, and parallelising slow functions on Windows, Mac, and Linux.")

associated metrics (Eavg, E50, E90, Emax).  Ideally predicted probabilities from
a prediction model should align with observed probabilities.  Calibration curves
relate predicted probabilities (or a transformation thereof) to observed
outcomes via a flexible non-linear smoothing function.  pmcalibration allows
users to choose between several smoothers (regression splines, generalized
additive models/GAMs, lowess, loess).  Both binary and time-to-event outcomes
are supported.  See Van Calster et al. (2016)

calculates the change in the probability of the event occurring given a change
in a theoretical variable.  Second, it calculates the rolling difference in the
future probability of the event for two scenarios: one where the event occurred
at a given time and one where the event does not occur.  The package is
consistent with the recent movement to depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret
quantities of interest with the requisite measures of uncertainty.  It is the
first to make it easy for researchers to interpret short- and long-term effects
of explanatory variables in binary autoregressive models, which can have
important implications for the correct interpretation of these models.")

generator may be normal, Student-t, power exponential, slash, hyperbolic,
sinh-normal, or type II logistic.  Diagnostic tools associated with the fitted
model, such as the residuals, local influence measures, leverage measures, and
goodness-of-fit statistics, are implemented.  The estimation process follows the
maximum likelihood approach and, currently, the package supports two types of
estimators: the usual maximum likelihood estimator and the penalized maximum
likelihood estimator.  More details about power logit regression models are
described in Queiroz and Ferrari (2022) <@code{arXiv:2202.01697>}.")

overlaying smoothing curves and median lines.  Plots are drawn using ggplot2'.")

rectangles, circles and ellipses with centimeter as their unit.  Thus their
sizes do not change when the coordinate system or the aspect ratio changes.
@code{annotation_transparent_text()} draws labels with transparent texts.
@code{annotation_shading_polygon()} draws irregular polygons with shading
colors.  Functions in the second group generate coordinates for regular shapes

     "Multivariate ordered probit model, i.e.  the extension of the scalar ordered
probit model where the observed variables have dimension greater than one.
Estimation of the parameters is done via maximization of the pairwise
likelihood, a special case of the composite likelihood obtained as product of
bivariate marginal distributions.  The package uses the Fortran 77 subroutine
SADMVN by Alan Genz, with minor adaptations made by Adelchi Azzalini in his
\"mvnormt\" package for evaluating the two-dimensional Gaussian integrals involved
in the pairwise log-likelihood.  Optimization of the latter objective function
is performed via quasi-Newton box-constrained optimization algorithm, as
implemented in nlminb.")

    (description
     "Log-multiplicative association models (LMA) are models for cross-classifications
of categorical variables where interactions are represented by products of
category scale values and an association parameter.  Maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) fails for moderate to large numbers of categorical variables.
The @code{pleLMA} package overcomes this limitation of MLE by using
pseudo-likelihood estimation to fit the models to small or large
cross-classifications dichotomous or multi-category variables.  Originally
proposed by Besag (1974, <doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1974.tb00999.x>),
pseudo-likelihood estimation takes large complex models and breaks it down into
smaller ones.  Rather than maximizing the likelihood of the joint distribution
of all the variables, a pseudo-likelihood function, which is the product
likelihoods from conditional distributions, is maximized.  LMA models can be
derived from a number of different frameworks including (but not limited to)
graphical models and uni-dimensional and multi-dimensional item response theory
models.  More details about the models and estimation can be found in the
vignette.")

    (description
     "Advances in automated document classification has led to identifying massive
numbers of clinical concepts from handwritten clinical notes.  These high
dimensional clinical concepts can serve as highly informative predictors in
building classification algorithms for identifying patients with different
clinical conditions, commonly referred to as patient phenotyping.  However, from
a planning perspective, it is critical to ensure that enough data is available
for the phenotyping algorithm to obtain a desired classification performance.
This challenge in sample size planning is further exacerbated by the high
dimension of the feature space and the inherent imbalance of the response class.
 Currently available sample size planning methods can be categorized into: (i)
model-based approaches that predict the sample size required for achieving a
desired accuracy using a linear machine learning classifier and (ii) learning
curve-based approaches (Figueroa et al. (2012) <doi:10.1186/1472-6947-12-8>)
that fit an inverse power law curve to pilot data to extrapolate performance.
We develop model-based approaches for imbalanced data with correlated features,
deriving sample size formulas for performance metrics that are sensitive to
class imbalance such as Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve
(AUC) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).  This is done using a two-step
approach where we first perform feature selection using the innovated High
Criticism thresholding method (Hall and Jin (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOS764>),
then determine the sample size by optimizing the two performance metrics.
Further, we develop software in the form of an R package named @code{planningML}
and an R Shiny app to facilitate the convenient implementation of the developed
model-based approaches and learning curve approaches for imbalanced data.  We
apply our methods to the problem of phenotyping rare outcomes using the
MIMIC-III electronic health record database.  We show that our developed methods
which relate training data size and performance on AUC and MCC, can predict the
true or observed performance from linear ML classifiers such as LASSO and SVM at
different training data sizes.  Therefore, in high-dimensional classification
analysis with imbalanced data and correlated features, our approach can
efficiently and accurately determine the sample size needed for machine-learning
based classification.")

generalized to accommodate ties of any order in the ranking.  Partial rankings,
in which only a subset of items are ranked in each ranking, are also
accommodated in the implementation.  Disconnected/weakly connected networks
implied by the rankings may be handled by adding pseudo-rankings with a
hypothetical item.  Optionally, a multivariate normal prior may be set on the
log-worth parameters and ranker reliabilities may be incorporated as proposed by
Raman and Joachims (2014) <doi:10.1145/2623330.2623654>.  Maximum a posteriori

     "Pharmacokinetics is the study of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and

change as the drug moves through the different compartments of the body.  For
pharmacokinetic modeling and analysis, it is essential to understand the basic
pharmacokinetic parameters.  All parameters are considered, but only some of
parameters are used in the model.  Therefore, we need to convert the estimated
parameters to the other parameters after fitting the specific pharmacokinetic
model.  This package is developed to help this converting work.  For more
detailed explanation of pharmacokinetic parameters, see \"Gabrielsson and Weiner\"

suggested in the literature are included.  Additional compelling features
comprise posterior probabilities, an implementation of an
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and PIN decomposition into layers, and
into bad/good components.  Versatile data simulation tools, and trade
classification algorithms are among the supplementary utilities.  The package
provides fast, compact, and precise utilities to tackle the sophisticated,
error-prone, and time-consuming estimation procedure of informed trading, and
this solely using the raw trade-level data.")

 The main tools are allele similarity clusters, and allele based genotype.  The
first tool is designed to reduce the ambiguity within the immunoglobulin heavy
chain V alleles.  The ambiguity is caused by duplicated or similar alleles which
are shared among different genes.  The second tool is an allele based genotype,
that determined the presence of an allele based on a threshold derived from a
naive population.  See Peres et al. (2023) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkad603>.")

allowing larger (up to 2 GB) data files to piggyback on a repository as assets
attached to individual @code{GitHub} releases.  These files are not handled by
git in any way, but instead are uploaded, downloaded, or edited directly by
calls through the @code{GitHub} API. These data files can be versioned manually
by creating different releases.  This approach works equally well with public or

    (description
     "This package provides a unified method, called M statistic, is provided for
detecting phylogenetic signals in continuous traits, discrete traits, and
multi-trait combinations.  Blomberg and Garland (2002)
<doi:10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00472.x> provided a widely accepted statistical
definition of the phylogenetic signal, which is the \"tendency for related
species to resemble each other more than they resemble species drawn at random
from the tree\".  The M statistic strictly adheres to the definition of
phylogenetic signal, formulating an index and developing a method of testing in
strict accordance with the definition, instead of relying on correlation
analysis or evolutionary models.  The novel method equivalently expressed the
textual definition of the phylogenetic signal as an inequality equation of the
phylogenetic and trait distances and constructed the M statistic.  Also, there
are more distance-based methods under development.")

nonlinear least squares models are commonly used to express photosynthetic
response under changing light conditions and has been well supported in the
literature, but distinctions in each mathematical model represent moderately
different assumptions about physiology and trait relationships which ultimately
produce different calculated functional trait values.  These models were all
thoughtfully discussed and curated by Lobo et al. (2013)
<doi:10.1007/s11099-013-0045-y> to express the importance of selecting an
appropriate model for analysis, and methods were established in Davis et al. (in

MODELING: Simulate C3 photosynthesis using the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, Berry
(1980) <doi:10.1007/BF00386231> model as described in Buckley and Diaz-Espejo
(2015) <doi:10.1111/pce.12459>.  It uses units to ensure that parameters are
properly specified and transformed before calculations.  Temperature response
functions get automatically \"baked\" into all parameters based on leaf
temperature following Bernacchi et al. (2002) <doi:10.1104/pp.008250>.  The
package includes boundary layer, cuticular, stomatal, and mesophyll conductances
to CO2, which each can vary on the upper and lower portions of the leaf.  Use
straightforward functions to simulate photosynthesis over environmental
gradients such as Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) and leaf
temperature, or over trait gradients such as CO2 conductance or photochemistry.

true characteristic of the patient is not available.  Instead we can retrieve
the International Classification of Disease code related to the disease of
interest or we can count the occurrence of the Unified Medical Language System.
None of them is the true phenotype which needs chart review to identify.
However chart review is time consuming and costly. @code{PheVis} is an algorithm
which is phenotyping (i.e identify a characteristic) at the visit level in an
unsupervised fashion.  It can be used for chronic or acute diseases.  An example
of how to use @code{PheVis} is available in the vignette.  Basically there are
two functions that are to be used: @code{`train_phevis()}` which trains the
algorithm and @code{`test_phevis()}` which get the predicted probabilities.  The
detailed method is described in preprint by FertÃ© et al. (2020)

quantitative genetics. @code{PhenotypeSimulator} allows for the flexible
simulation of phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant and
infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as
non-genetic covariate effects, observational noise and additional correlation
effects.  The different phenotype components are combined into a final phenotype
while controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the
components.  For each effect component, the number of variables, their
distribution and the design of their effect across traits can be customised.
For the simulation of the genetic effects, external genotype data from a number
of standard software ('plink', hapgen2'/ impute2', genome', bimbam', simple text
files) can be imported.  The final simulated phenotypes and its components can
be automatically saved into .rds or .csv files.  In addition, they can be saved
in formats compatible with commonly used genetic association software ('gemma',
bimbam', plink', snptest', @code{LiMMBo}').")

firstly, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering using Ward's algorithm is
calculated for phages.  They will be clustered according to bacteria lysed by
them. @code{PhageCocktail()} chooses how many clusters are needed in order to
select 1 phage per cluster.  Once the function has one phage per cluster, it
calculates Phi.  If the number of clusters is less than Phi number, it will be
changed to obtain, as minimum, this quantity of candidates (phages).  Then, it
calculates the best combination of Phi phages using those selected during the
clustering with Ward algorithm.  If you use @code{PhageCocktail}, please cite it

     "Fits right-truncated meta-analysis (RTMA), a bias correction for the joint
effects of p-hacking (i.e., manipulation of results within studies to obtain
significant, positive estimates) and traditional publication bias (i.e., the
selective publication of studies with significant, positive results) in
meta-analyses [see Mathur MB (2022). \"Sensitivity analysis for p-hacking in
meta-analyses.\" <doi:10.31219/osf.io/ezjsx>.].  Unlike publication bias alone,
p-hacking that favors significant, positive results (termed \"affirmative\") can
distort the distribution of affirmative results.  To bias-correct results from
affirmative studies would require strong assumptions on the exact nature of
p-hacking.  In contrast, joint p-hacking and publication bias do not distort the
distribution of published nonaffirmative results when there is stringent
p-hacking (e.g., investigators who hack always eventually obtain an affirmative
result) or when there is stringent publication bias (e.g., nonaffirmative
results from hacked studies are never published).  This means that any published
nonaffirmative results are from unhacked studies.  Under these assumptions, RTMA
involves analyzing only the published nonaffirmative results to essentially
impute the full underlying distribution of all results prior to selection due to
p-hacking and/or publication bias.  The package also provides diagnostic plots
described in Mathur (2022).")

     "This package provides a collection of R functions that are widely used by the
Petersen Lab.  Included are functions for various purposes, including evaluating
the accuracy of judgments and predictions, performing scoring of assessments,
generating correlation matrices, conversion of data between various types, data
management, psychometric evaluation, extensions related to latent variable
modeling, various plotting capabilities, and other miscellaneous useful
functions.  By making the package available, we hope to make our methods
reproducible and replicable by others and to help others perform their data
processing and analysis methods more easily and efficiently.  The codebase is
provided in Petersen (2024) <doi:10.5281/zenodo.7602890> and on CRAN: <doi:
10.32614/CRAN.package.petersenlab>.  The package is described in \"Principles of

uses a two-part modeling framework to handle semi-continuous data by separately
modeling the positive part of the outcome and an indicator of whether each
outcome is positive, but still results in a single treatment rule.  High
dimensional data is handled with a cooperative lasso penalty, which encourages
the coefficients in the two models to have the same sign.")

non-parametric analysis on microbiome data for biomarker discovery aims.  This
test executes thousands of comparisons in a pairwise manner, after a random
shuffling of data into the different groups of study with a prior selection of
the microbiome features with the largest variation among groups.  Previous to
the permutation test itself, data can be normalized according to different
methods proposed to handle microbiome data ('proportions or Anders').  The
median-based differences between groups resulting from the multiple simulations
are fitted to a normal distribution with the aim to calculate their
significance.  A multiple testing correction based on Benjamini-Hochberg method
(fdr) is finally applied to extract the differentially presented features
between groups of your dataset.  LATEST UPDATES: v1.1 and olders incorporates
function to parse COLUMN format; v1.2 and olders incorporates -optimize-
function to maximize evaluation of features with largest inter-class variation;
v1.3 and olders includes the -size.effect- function to perform estimation
statistics using the bootstrap-coupled approach implemented in the dabestr
(>=0.3.0) R package.  Current v1.3.2 fixed bug with \"Class\" recognition and

    (description
     "This package provides tools for statistical testing of correlation coefficients
through robust permutation method and large sample approximation method.
Tailored to different types of correlation coefficients including Pearson
correlation coefficient, weighted Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman
correlation coefficient, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient.The
robust permutation test controls type I error under general scenarios when
sample size is small and two variables are dependent but uncorrelated.  The
large sample approximation test generally controls type I error when the sample
size is large (>200).")

using meta-regression.  However, if the number of moderators is large relative
to the number of studies, such an analysis may be overfit.  Penalized
meta-regression is useful in these cases, because it shrinks the regression

     "When working with big data sets, RAM conservation is critically important.
However, it is not always enough to just monitor the size of the objects
created.  So-called \"copy-on-modify\" behavior, characteristic of R, means that
some expressions or functions may require an unexpectedly large amount of RAM
overhead.  For example, replacing a single value in a matrix duplicates that
matrix in the back-end, making this task require twice as much RAM as that used
by the matrix itself.  This package makes it easy to monitor the total and peak
RAM used so that developers can quickly identify and eliminate RAM hungry code.")

<doi:10.1016/0304-4076(94)01642-D>.  Estimation of the model parameters relies
on the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and instrumental variables (IV)
estimation, numerical optimization (when nonlinear moment conditions are
employed) and the computation of closed form solutions (when estimation is based
on linear moment conditions).  One-step, two-step and iterated estimation is
available.  For inference and specification testing, Windmeijer (2005)
<doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.02.005> and doubly corrected standard errors (Hwang,
Kang, Lee, 2021 <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.010>) are available.
Additionally, serial correlation tests, tests for overidentification, and Wald
tests are provided.  Functions for visualizing panel data structures and
modeling results obtained from GMM estimation are also available.  The plot
methods include functions to plot unbalanced panel structure, coefficient ranges
and coefficient paths across GMM iterations (the latter is implemented according
to the plot shown in Hansen and Lee, 2021 <doi:10.3982/ECTA16274>).  For a more
detailed description of the GMM-based functionality, please see Fritsch, Pua,
Schnurbus (2021) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-035>.  For more details on the IV-based

     "This package provides a collection of privacy-preserving distributed algorithms
for conducting multi-site data analyses.  The regression analyses can be linear
regression for continuous outcome, logistic regression for binary outcome, Cox
proportional hazard regression for time-to event outcome, Poisson regression for
count outcome, or multi-categorical regression for nominal or ordinal outcome.
The PDA algorithm runs on a lead site and only requires summary statistics from
collaborating sites, with one or few iterations.  The package can be used
together with the online system (<https://pda-ota.pdamethods.org/>) for safe and
convenient collaboration.  For more information, please visit our software
websites: <https://github.com/Penncil/pda>, and <https://pdamethods.org/>.")

    (description
     "Phylogenetic comparative methods represent models of continuous trait data
associated with the tips of a phylogenetic tree.  Examples of such models are
Gaussian continuous time branching stochastic processes such as Brownian motion
(BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, which regard the data at the tips of
the tree as an observed (final) state of a Markov process starting from an
initial state at the root and evolving along the branches of the tree.  The
PCMBase R package provides a general framework for manipulating such models.
This framework consists of an application programming interface for specifying
data and model parameters, and efficient algorithms for simulating trait
evolution under a model and calculating the likelihood of model parameters for
an assumed model and trait data.  The package implements a growing collection of
models, which currently includes BM, OU, BM/OU with jumps, two-speed OU as well
as mixed Gaussian models, in which different types of the above models can be
associated with different branches of the tree.  The PCMBase package is limited
to trait-simulation and likelihood calculation of (mixed) Gaussian phylogenetic
models.  The PCMFit package provides functionality for inference of these models
to tree and trait data.  The package web-site
<https://venelin.github.io/PCMBase/> provides access to the documentation and
other resources.")

not a trivial task, and it lacks standard practices.The PAM50 classifier, which
uses 50 gene centroid correlation distances to classify tumors, faces challenges
with balancing estrogen receptor (ER) status and gene centering.  The PCAPAM50

create a gene expression-based ER-balanced subset for gene centering, avoiding
the use of protein expression-based ER data resulting into an enhanced Breast

differences in the variance components (eigenvalues) of the deconstructed
covariance matrices.  The angle plot presents the information loss when moving
from the PCA decomposition of one dataset to the PCA decomposition of the other.
 The chroma plot describes the loading patterns of the two datasets, thereby
presenting the relative weighting and importance of the variables from the

     "The t-designs represent a generalized class of balanced incomplete block designs
in which the number of blocks in which any t-tuple of treatments (t >= 2) occur
together is a constant.  When the focus of an experiment lies in grading and
selecting treatment subgroups, t-designs would be preferred over the
conventional ones, as they have the additional advantage of t-tuple balance.
t-designs can be advantageously used in identifying the best crop-livestock
combination for a particular location in Integrated Farming Systems that will
help in generating maximum profit.  But as the number of components increases,
the number of possible t-component combinations will also increase.  Most often,
combinations derived from specific components are only practically feasible, for
example, in a specific locality, farmers may not be interested in keeping a pig
or goat and hence combinations involving these may not be of any use in that
locality.  In such situations partially balanced t-designs with few selected
combinations appearing in a constant number of blocks (while others not at all
appearing) may be useful (Sayantani Karmakar, Cini Varghese, Seema Jaggi & Mohd
Harun (2021)<doi:10.1080/03610918.2021.2008436>).  Further, every location may
not have the resources to form equally sized homogeneous blocks.  Partially
balanced t-designs with unequal block sizes (Damaraju Raghavarao & Bei Zhou
(1998)<doi:10.1080/03610929808832657>.  Sayantani Karmakar, Cini Varghese, Seema
Jaggi & Mohd Harun (2022).\" Partially Balanced t-designs with unequal block
sizes\") prove to be more suitable for such situations.This package generates
three series of partially balanced t-designs namely Series 1, Series 2 and
Series 3.  Series 1 and Series 2 are designs having equal block sizes and with
treatment structures 4(t + 1) and a prime number, respectively.  Series 3
consists of designs with unequal block sizes and with treatment structure
n(n-1)/2.  This package is based on the function named @code{PBtD()} for
generating partially balanced t-designs along with their parameters, information
matrices, average variance factors and canonical efficiency factors.")

     "This package provides a modeling tool dedicated to biological network modeling
(Bertrand and others 2020, <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa855>).  It allows for
single or joint modeling of, for instance, genes and proteins.  It starts with
the selection of the actors that will be the used in the reverse engineering
upcoming step.  An actor can be included in that selection based on its
differential measurement (for instance gene expression or protein abundance) or
on its time course profile.  Wrappers for actors clustering functions and
cluster analysis are provided.  It also allows reverse engineering of biological
networks taking into account the observed time course patterns of the actors.
Many inference functions are provided and dedicated to get specific features for
the inferred network such as sparsity, robust links, high confidence links or
stable through resampling links.  Some simulation and prediction tools are also
available for cascade networks (Jung and others 2014,
<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt705>).  Example of use with microarray or RNA-Seq
data are provided.")

which involves a weighted combination of neighboring vertices and their
associated signals.  The package then uses a decay function to project these
signals, creating geodesic paths on a 2D-image space. @code{PathwaySpace} could
have various applications, such as visualizing and analyzing network data in a
graphical format that highlights the relationships and signal strengths between
vertices.  It can be particularly useful for understanding the influence of
signals through complex networks.  By combining graph theory, signal processing,
and visualization, the @code{PathwaySpace} package provides a novel way of
representing and analyzing graph data.")

conclusions. @code{pathfindR} is a tool for enrichment analysis utilizing active

protein-protein interaction network using a user-provided list of genes and
associated p values.  It then performs enrichment analyses on the identified
subnetworks, identifying enriched terms (i.e.  pathways or, more broadly, gene
sets) that possibly underlie the phenotype of interest. @code{pathfindR} also
offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and identify representative
terms in each cluster, to score the enriched terms per sample and to visualize
analysis results.  The enrichment, clustering and other methods implemented in
@code{pathfindR} are described in detail in Ulgen E, Ozisik O, Sezerman OU.

Forensic applications include exclusion probabilities, genotype distributions

retrieval of matrices developed for the jmatrix package but the functionality of
jmatrix is included here, so you do not need to install it.  Also, it is used by
package scellpam', so if you have installed it, you do not need to install this
package.  PAM can be applied to sets of data whose dissimilarity matrix can be
very big.  It has been tested with up to 100.000 points.  It does this with the
help of the code developed for other package, jmatrix', which allows the matrix
not to be loaded in R memory (which would force it to be of double type) but it
gets from disk, which allows using float (or even smaller data types).
Moreover, the dissimilarity matrix is calculated in parallel if the computer has
several cores so it can open many threads.  The initial part of the PAM
algorithm can be done with the BUILD or LAB algorithms; the BUILD algorithm has
been implemented in parallel.  The optimization phase implements the
@code{FastPAM1} algorithm, also in parallel.  Finally, calculation of silhouette
is available and also implemented in parallel.")

     "See Miroshnikov and Conlon (2014) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0108425>.  Recent
Bayesian Markov chain Monto Carlo (MCMC) methods have been developed for big
data sets that are too large to be analyzed using traditional statistical
methods.  These methods partition the data into non-overlapping subsets, and
perform parallel independent Bayesian MCMC analyses on the data subsets,
creating independent subposterior samples for each data subset.  These
independent subposterior samples are combined through four functions in this
package, including averaging across subset samples, weighted averaging across
subsets samples, and kernel smoothing across subset samples.  The four functions
assume the user has previously run the Bayesian analysis and has produced the
independent subposterior samples outside of the package; the functions use as
input the array of subposterior samples.  The methods have been demonstrated to
be useful for Bayesian MCMC models including Bayesian logistic regression,
Bayesian Gaussian mixture models and Bayesian hierarchical Poisson-Gamma models.
 The methods are appropriate for Bayesian hierarchical models with
hyperparameters, as long as data values in a single level of the hierarchy are
not split into subsets.")

When bridging study patients are enrolled based on CTA assay results,
Binomial-based confidence intervals (CI) may are not appropriate for PPV CI
estimation.  Bootstrap CIs which are not restricted by the Binomial assumption
may be used for PPV CI estimation only when PPV is not 100%.  Bootstrap CI is
not valid when PPV is 100% and becomes a single value of [1, 1].  We proposed a
risk ratio-based method for constructing CI for PPV. By simulation we
illustrated that the coverage probability of the proposed CI is close to the
nominal value even when PPV is high and negative percent agreement (NPA) is
close to 100%.  There is a lack of R package for PPV CI calculation.  we
developed a publicly available R package along with this shiny app to implement
the proposed approach and some other existing methods.")

     "This package provides a customisable R shiny app for immersively visualising,
mapping and annotating panospheric (360 degree) imagery.  The flexible interface
allows annotation of any geocoded images using up to 4 user specified dropdown
menus.  The app uses leaflet to render maps that display the geo-locations of
images and panellum <https://pannellum.org/>, a lightweight panorama viewer for
the web, to render images in virtual 360 degree viewing mode.  Key functions
include the ability to draw on & export parts of 360 images for downstream
applications.  Users can also draw polygons and points on map imagery related to
the panoramic images and export them for further analysis.  Downstream
applications include using annotations to train Artificial Intelligence/Machine
Learning (AI/ML) models and geospatial modelling and analysis of camera based
survey data.")

(2023) <http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/tscs.pdf> proposes a nonparametric
generalization of the difference-in-differences estimator, which does not rely
on the linearity assumption as often done in practice.  Researchers first select
a method of matching each treated observation for a given unit in a particular
time period with control observations from other units in the same time period
that have a similar treatment and covariate history.  These methods include
standard matching methods based on propensity score and Mahalanobis distance, as
well as weighting methods.  Once matching and refinement is done, treatment

source document into JSON-formatted AST, alter it by so called filters and pass
the altered JSON-formatted AST back to pandoc'.  This package provides functions
which allow to write such filters in native R code.  Although this package is
inspired by the Python package pandocfilters
<https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/>, it provides additional convenience
functions which make it simple to use the pandocfilters package as a report
generator.  Since pandocfilters inherits most of it's functionality from pandoc
it can create documents in many formats (for more information see
<https://pandoc.org/>) but is also bound to the same limitations as pandoc'.")

nonlinear, parametric, semi-parametric, or nonparametric, and correctly
specified or mis-specified.  The first measure, R-squared, is an extension of
the classical R-squared statistic for a linear model, quantifying the prediction
function's ability to capture the variability of the response.  The second
measure, L-squared, quantifies the prediction function's bias for predicting the
mean regression function.  When used together, they give a complete summary of
the predictive power of a prediction function.  Please refer to Gang Li and
Xiaoyan Wang (2016) <@code{arXiv:1611.03063>} for more details.")

individuals cannot be identified---the data from which can conceptually be seen
as a clustered point process (Stevenson, Borchers, and Fewster, 2019

     "This package provides tools for transforming, a posteriori time-scaling, and
modifying phylogenies containing extinct (i.e.  fossil) lineages.  In
particular, most users are interested in the functions @code{timePaleoPhy},
bin_@code{timePaleoPhy}, cal3@code{TimePaleoPhy} and
bin_cal3@code{TimePaleoPhy}, which date cladograms of fossil taxa using
stratigraphic data.  This package also contains a large number of likelihood
functions for estimating sampling and diversification rates from different types
of data available from the fossil record (e.g. range data, occurrence data,
etc).  paleotree users can also simulate diversification and sampling in the
fossil record using the function @code{simFossilRecord}, which is a detailed
simulator for branching birth-death-sampling processes composed of discrete
taxonomic units arranged in ancestor-descendant relationships.  Users can use
@code{simFossilRecord} to simulate diversification in incompletely sampled
fossil records, under various models of morphological differentiation (i.e.  the
various patterns by which morphotaxa originate from one another), and with
time-dependent, longevity-dependent and/or diversity-dependent rates of
diversification, extinction and sampling.  Additional functions allow users to
translate simulated ancestor-descendant data from @code{simFossilRecord} into
standard time-scaled phylogenies or unscaled cladograms that reflect the
relationships among taxon units.")

second stage with systematic random sampling out of a sample of 2,692 clusters
selected using probability proportional to size sampling.  Six questionnaires
were used in the survey: (1) a household questionnaire to collect basic
demographic information on all de jure household members (usual residents), the
household, and the dwelling; (2) a water quality testing questionnaire
administered in three households in each cluster of the sample; (3) a
questionnaire for individual women administered in each household to all women
age 15-49 years; (4) a questionnaire for individual men administered in every
second household to all men age 15-49 years; (5) an under-5 questionnaire,
administered to mothers (or caretakers) of all children under 5 living in the
household; and (6) a questionnaire for children age 5-17 years, administered to
the mother (or caretaker) of one randomly selected child age 5-17 years living
in the household (<http://www.mics.unicef.org/surveys>).")

identifies latent group structures and group-specific coefficients in a single

used specifically for constraints with the lasso formulation, but the method
described in the @code{PaC} paper can be used for a variety of scenarios.  In
