distribution according to control of its (i) mean, e.g. the usual BH-FDR
procedure, or via the probability that it exceeds a given value, delta, via (ii)
the Romano procedure, or via (iii) my procedure based upon asymptotic
approximation.  Likewise, we can think of the power in multiple testing
experiments in terms of a summary of the distribution of the True Positive
Proportion (TPP).  The package will compute power, sample size or any other
missing parameter required for power based upon (i) the mean of the TPP which is
the average power (ii) the probability that the TPP exceeds a given value,
lambda, via my asymptotic approximation procedure.  The theoretical results are
described in Izmirlian, G. (2020) Stat.  and Prob.  letters,

criteria are implemented: RMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross

modifications (PTMs) in proteins, with particular emphasis on the sulfoxidation
of methionine residues.  Features include the ability to download, filter and
analyze data from the sulfoxidation database MetOSite', and integrate data from
other main PTMs (other databases).  Utilities to search and characterize
S-aromatic motifs in proteins are also provided.  In addition, functions to
analyze sequence environments around modifiable residues in proteins can be
found.  For instance, ptm allows to search for amino acids either
overrepresented or avoided around the modifiable residues from the proteins of
interest.  Functions tailored to test statistical hypothesis related to these
differential sequence environments are also implemented.  A number of utilities
to assess the effect of the modification/mutation of a given residue on the

specification test, (4) weighted estimation of treatment effect, and (5)
augmented estimation of treatment effect with outcome regression.  The weighting
methods include the inverse probability weight (IPW) for estimating the average
treatment effect (ATE), the IPW for average treatment effect of the treated
(ATT), the IPW for the average treatment effect of the controls (ATC), the
matching weight (MW), the overlap weight (OVERLAP), and the trapezoidal weight

    (description
     "This package provides a framework for analysing state sequences with
probabilistic suffix trees (PST), the construction that stores variable length
Markov chains (VLMC).  Besides functions for learning and optimizing VLMC
models, the PST library includes many additional tools to analyse sequence data
with these models: visualization tools, functions for sequence prediction and
artificial sequences generation, as well as for context and pattern mining.  The
package is specifically adapted to the field of social sciences by allowing to
learn VLMC models from sets of individual sequences possibly containing missing
values, and by accounting for case weights.  The library also allows to compute
probabilistic divergence between two models, and to fit segmented VLMC, where
sub-models fitted to distinct strata of the learning sample are stored in a
single PST. This software results from research work executed within the
framework of the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research LIVES, which is
financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.  The authors are grateful to
the Swiss National Science Foundation for its financial support.")

Subpathway Analysis (DCSA) are developed to flexible identify subtype specific
and dynamic changed subpathways respectively.  The operation modes include
extraction of subpathways from biological pathways, inference of subpathway
activities in the context of gene expression data, identification of subtype
specific subpathways with SubSEA, identification of dynamic changed subpathways
associated with the cancer developmental stage with DCSA, and visualization of
the activities of resulting subpathways by using box plots and heat maps.  Its
capabilities render the tool could find the specific abnormal subpathways in the
cancer dataset with multi-phenotype samples.")

intermediate biomarker response as a principal surrogate of a clinical response
to treatment (i.e., principal stratification effect modification analysis), as
described in Juraska M, Huang Y, and Gilbert PB (2020), Inference on treatment
effect modification by biomarker response in a three-phase sampling design,
Biostatistics, 21(3): 545-560 <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy074>.  The methods
avoid the restrictive placebo structural risk modeling assumption common to past
methods and further improve robustness by the use of nonparametric kernel
smoothing for biomarker density estimation.  A randomized controlled two-group
clinical efficacy trial is assumed with an ordered categorical or continuous
univariate biomarker response measured at a fixed timepoint post-randomization
and with a univariate baseline surrogate measure allowed to be observed in only
a subset of trial participants with an observed biomarker response (see the
flexible three-phase sampling design in the paper for details).  Bootstrap-based
procedures are available for pointwise and simultaneous confidence intervals and
testing of four relevant hypotheses.  Summary and plotting functions are
provided for estimation results.")

models in multiply imputed datasets.  Backward and forward selection can be done
from the pooled model using Rubin's Rules (RR), the D1, D2, D3, D4 and the
median p-values method.  This is also possible for Mixed models.  The models can
contain continuous, dichotomous, categorical and restricted cubic spline
predictors and interaction terms between	all these type of predictors.  The
stability of the models	can be evaluated using bootstrapping and cluster
bootstrapping.  The package further contains functions to pool the model
performance as ROC/AUC, R-squares, scaled Brier score, H&L test and
calibration	plots for logistic regression models.  Internal validation can
be	done with cross-validation or bootstrapping.  The adjusted intercept after
shrinkage of pooled regression coefficients can be obtained.  Backward and
forward selection as part of internal validation is possible.  A function to
externally validate logistic prediction models in multiple imputed datasets is
available and a function to compare models.  Eekhout (2017)

    (description
     "This package provides a simulation framework to simulate streamflow time series
with similar main characteristics as observed data.  These characteristics
include the distribution of daily streamflow values and their temporal
correlation as expressed by short- and long-range dependence.  The approach is
based on the randomization of the phases of the Fourier transform or the phases
of the wavelet transform.  The function prsim() is applicable to single site
simulation and uses the Fourier transform.  The function prsim.wave() extends
the approach to multiple sites and is based on the complex wavelet transform.
The function prsim.weather() extends the approach to multiple variables for
weather generation.  We further use the flexible four-parameter Kappa
distribution, which allows for the extrapolation to yet unobserved low and high
flows.  Alternatively, the empirical or any other distribution can be used.  A
detailed description of the simulation approach for single sites and an
application example can be found in <doi:10.5194/hess-23-3175-2019>.  A detailed
description and evaluation of the wavelet-based multi-site approach can be found
in <doi:10.5194/hess-24-3967-2020>.  A detailed description and evaluation of
the multi-variable and multi-site weather generator can be found in

    (description
     "In a typical protein labelling procedure, proteins are chemically tagged with a
functional group, usually at specific sites, then digested into peptides, which
are then analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to generate peptide fingerprint.
Relative to the control, peptides that are heavier by the mass of the labelling
group are informative for sequence determination.  Searching for peptides with
such mass shifts, however, can be difficult.  This package, designed to tackle
this inconvenience, takes as input the mass list of two or multiple MALDI-TOF MS
mass lists, and makes pairwise comparisons between the labeled groups vs.
control, and restores centroid mass spectra with highlighted peaks of interest
for easier visual examination.  Particularly, peaks differentiated by the mass
of the labelling group are defined as a âpairâ, those with equal masses as a
âmatchâ, and all the other peaks as a âmismatchâ.For more bioanalytical
background information, refer to following publications: Jingjing Deng (2015)

    (description
     "This package provides a reliable and flexible toolbox to score patient-reported
outcome (PRO), Quality of Life (QOL), and other psychometric measures.  The
guiding philosophy is that scoring errors can be eliminated by using a limited
number of well-tested, well-behaved functions to score PRO-like measures.  The
workhorse of the package is the scoreScale function, which can be used to score
most single-scale measures.  It can reverse code items that need to be reversed
before scoring and pro-rate scores for missing item data.  Currently, three
different types of scores can be output: summed item scores, mean item scores,
and scores scaled to range from 0 to 100.  The PROscorerTools functions can be
used to write new functions that score more complex measures.  In fact,
PROscorerTools functions are the building blocks of the scoring functions in the
PROscorer package (which is a repository of functions that score specific
commonly-used instruments).  Users are encouraged to use PROscorerTools to write
scoring functions for their favorite PRO-like instruments, and to submit these
functions for inclusion in PROscorer (a tutorial vignette will be added soon).
The long-term vision for the PROscorerTools and PROscorer packages is to provide
an easy-to-use system to facilitate the incorporation of PRO measures into
research studies in a scientifically rigorous and reproducible manner.  These
packages and their vignettes are intended to help establish and promote \"best
practices\" for scoring and describing PRO-like measures in research.")

method is proposed here.  The two-dimensional scatter plot of any projection
method can construct a topographic map which displays unapparent data structures
by using distance and density information of the data.  The generalized
U*-matrix renders this visualization in the form of a topographic map, which can
be used to automatically define the clusters of high-dimensional data.  The
whole system is based on Thrun and Ultsch, \"Using Projection based Clustering to
Find Distance and Density based Clusters in High-Dimensional Data\"
<DOI:10.1007/s00357-020-09373-2>.  Selecting the correct projection method will
result in a visualization in which mountains surround each cluster.  The number
of clusters can be determined by counting valleys on the topographic map.  Most
projection methods are wrappers for already available methods in R. By contrast,
the neighbor retrieval visualizer (NeRV) is based on C++ source code of the
dredviz software package, and the Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA) is
translated from MATLAB ('SOM Toolbox 2.0) to R.")

Paasche indices are not transitive and are only to be used for binary
comparison.  All indices can also be decomposed into different components,
providing insightful information on the sources of productivity and
profitability changes.  In the use of Malmquist productivity index, the
technological change index can be further decomposed into bias technological
change components.  The package also allows to prohibit technological regression
(negative technological change).  In the case of the Fisher, Hicks-Moorsteen,
Laspeyres, Paasche and the transitive FÃ¤re-Primont and Lowe indices, it is
furthermore possible to rule out technological change.  Deflated shadow prices
can also be obtained.  Besides, the package allows parallel computing as an
option, depending on the user's computer configuration.  All computations are

sampling procedure, instead of having the sampling procedure generate them.  In
Lindblom (2014) <doi:10.2478/jos-2014-0047>, and therein cited articles, it is
shown how this is carried out and how it improves the estimates.  This package
supports two common fixed-size sampling procedures (simple random sampling and
probability-proportional-to-size sampling) and includes a function for
transforming the PRN's in order to control the sample overlap.")

     "Systematic conservation prioritization using mixed integer linear programming
(MILP).  It provides a flexible interface for building and solving conservation
planning problems.  Once built, conservation planning problems can be solved
using a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers.  By using
exact algorithm solvers, solutions can be generated that are guaranteed to be
optimal (or within a pre-specified optimality gap).  Furthermore, conservation
problems can be constructed to optimize the spatial allocation of different
management actions or zones, meaning that conservation practitioners can
identify solutions that benefit multiple stakeholders.  To solve large-scale or
complex conservation planning problems, users should install the Gurobi
optimization software (available from <https://www.gurobi.com/>) and the gurobi
R package (see Gurobi Installation Guide vignette for details).  Users can also
install the IBM CPLEX software (<https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer>)
and the cplexAPI R package (available at <https://github.com/cran/cplexAPI>).
Additionally, the rcbc R package (available at
<https://github.com/dirkschumacher/rcbc>) can be used to generate solutions
using the CBC optimization software (<https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc>).")

each row is a variant, each column is a sample, and the entries are presence - 1
- or absence - 0 - of the variant) that can be used as input for bGWAS tools.
When creating the binary variant matrix, prewas can perform 3 pre-processing
steps including: dealing with multiallelic SNPs, (optional) dealing with SNPs in
overlapping genes, and choosing a reference allele.  prewas can output matrices
for use with both SNP-based bGWAS and gene-based bGWAS. This method is described
in Saund et al. (2020) <doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000368>.  prewas can also provide
gene matrices for variants with specific annotations from the SnpEff software
(Cingolani et al.  2012).")

where it may not be possible to replicate all the lines in each environment due

designs have wide application potential as only a proportion of the test lines
are replicated at each environment.  A collection of several utility functions
related to p-Rep designs have been developed.  Here, the package contains four
functions for a complete stepwise analytical study of these designs.  Three
functions pRep1(), pRep2() and pRep3() are used to generate three new series of
p-Rep designs and also compute canonical efficiency factors, variance factors
between associates and average variance factors of these designs.  A fourth
function NCEV() is used to generate incidence matrix (N), information matrix
(C), canonical efficiency factor (E) and average variance factor (V).  This
function is general in nature and can be used for studying the characterization
properties of any block design.A construction procedure for p-Rep designs was
given by Williams et al.(2011)<doi:10.1002/bimj.201000102> which was tidious and
time consuming.  Here, in this package, three different methods have been given
to generate p-Rep designs easily.")

raw data files into one merged table and then aggregate the merged table (using

every step of the preparation.  The finalized table contains several
possibilities for dependent measures of the dependent variable.  Most suitable
when measuring variables in an interval or ratio scale (e.g., reaction-times)
and/or discrete values such as accuracy.  Main functions included are
file_merge() and prep().  The file_merge() function vertically merges individual
data files (in a long format) in which each line is a single observation to one
single dataset.  The prep() function aggregates the single dataset according to
any combination of grouping variables (i.e., between-subjects and
within-subjects independent variables, respectively), and returns a data frame
with a number of dependent measures for further analysis for each cell according
to the combination of provided grouping variables.  Dependent measures for each
cell include among others means before and after rejecting all values according
to a flexible standard deviation criteria, number of rejected values according
to the flexible standard deviation criteria, proportions of rejected values
according to the flexible standard deviation criteria, number of values before
rejection, means after rejecting values according to procedures described in Van
Selst & Jolicoeur (1994; suitable when measuring reaction-times), standard
deviations, medians, means according to any percentile (e.g., 0.05, 0.25, 0.75,

and discrete covariates.  It also allows for fixed effects in the response
model, where a spatial CAR (conditional autoregressive) term can be also
included.  Additionally, predictions may be made for the response, and missing
values for the covariates are handled.  Several samplers and label switching
moves are implemented along with diagnostic tools to assess convergence.  A
number of R functions for post-processing of the output are also provided.  In
addition to fitting mixtures, it may additionally be of interest to determine
which covariates actively drive the mixture components.  This is implemented in
the package as variable selection.  The main reference for the package is

     "Stochastic block model used for dynamic graphs represented by Poisson processes.
 To model recurrent interaction events in continuous time, an extension of the
stochastic block model is proposed where every individual belongs to a latent
group and interactions between two individuals follow a conditional
inhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity driven by the individualsâ latent
groups.  The model is shown to be identifiable and its estimation is based on a
semiparametric variational expectation-maximization algorithm.  Two versions of
the method are developed, using either a nonparametric histogram approach (with
an adaptive choice of the partition size) or kernel intensity estimators.  The
number of latent groups can be selected by an integrated classification
likelihood criterion.  Y. Baraud and L. BirgÃ© (2009).

    (description
     "Exploratory projection pursuit is a method to discovers structure in
multivariate data.  At heart this package uses a projection index to evaluate
how interesting a specific three-dimensional projection of multivariate data
(with more than three dimensions) is.  Typically, the main structure finding
algorithm starts at a random projection and then iteratively changes the
projection direction to move to a more interesting one.  In other words, the
projection index is maximised over the projection direction to find the most
interesting projection.  This maximum is, though, a local maximum.  So, this
code has the ability to restart the algorithm from many different starting
positions automatically.  Routines exist to plot a density estimate of
projection indices over the runs, this enables the user to obtain an idea of the
distribution of the projection indices, and, hence, which ones might be
interesting.  Individual projection solutions, including those identified as
interesting, can be extracted and plotted individually.  The package can make
use of the mclapply() function to execute multiple runs in parallel to speed up
index discovery.  Projection pursuit is similar to independent component
analysis.  This package uses a projection index that maximises an entropy
measure to look for projections that exhibit non-normality, and operates on
sphered data.  Hence, information from this package is different from that
obtained from principal components analysis, but the rationale behind both
methods is similar.  Nason, G. P. (1995) <doi:10.2307/2986135>.")

Power analysis is in the context of estimating the LATE (also known as the
complier average causal effect, or CACE), with calculations based on a test of
the null hypothesis that the LATE equals 0 with a two-sided alternative.  The
method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power
under minimal assumptions.  Package allows users to recover power, sample size
requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes.  Package also allows users to
work with absolute effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional
assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate adjustment.")

fitted with Bayesian inference using JAGS', WinBUGS', OpenBUGS', NIMBLE', Stan',
or even custom MCMC algorithms.  Although the coda R package provides some
methods for these objects, it is somewhat limited in easily performing
post-processing tasks for specific nodes.  Models are ever increasing in their
complexity and the number of tracked nodes, and oftentimes a user may wish to
summarize/diagnose sampling behavior for only a small subset of nodes at a time
for a particular question or figure.  Thus, many postpack functions support
performing tasks on a subset of nodes, where the subset is specified with
regular expressions.  The functions in postpack streamline the extraction,
summarization, and diagnostics of specific monitored nodes after model fitting.
Further, because there is rarely only ever one model under consideration,
postpack scales efficiently to perform the same tasks on output from multiple
models simultaneously, facilitating rapid assessment of model sensitivity to
changes in assumptions.")

non-parametric inference to be regularized for small sample sizes, while also
being more accurate than approximations such as variational Bayes.  The
concentration parameter is an effective sample size parameter, determining the
faith we have in the model versus the data.  When the concentration is low, the
samples are close to the exact Bayesian logistic regression method; when the
concentration is high, the samples are close to the simplified variational Bayes
logistic regression.  The method is described in full in the paper Lyddon,
Walker, and Holmes (2018), \"Nonparametric learning from Bayesian models with

to backtest a set of different portfolios, as well as by a course instructor to
assess the students in their portfolio design in a fully automated and
convenient manner, with results conveniently formatted in tables and plots.
Each portfolio design is easily defined as a function that takes as input a
window of the stock prices and outputs the portfolio weights.  Multiple
portfolios can be easily specified as a list of functions or as files in a
folder.  Multiple datasets can be conveniently extracted randomly from different
markets, different time periods, and different subsets of the stock universe.
The results can be later assessed and ranked with tables based on a number of
performance criteria (e.g., expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, drawdown,
turnover rate, return on investment, computational time, etc.), as well as
plotted in a number of ways with nice barplots and boxplots.")

functionality for ridge-type estimation of a potpourri of models.  Currently,
this estimation concerns that of various Gaussian graphical models from
different study designs.  Among others it considers the regular Gaussian
graphical model and a mixture of such models.  The porridge-package implements
the estimation of the former either from i) data with replicated observations by
penalized loglikelihood maximization using the regular ridge penalty on the
parameters (van Wieringen, Chen, 2021) or ii) from non-replicated data by means
of either a ridge estimator with multiple shrinkage targets (as presented in van
Wieringen et al.  2020, <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2020.104621>) or the generalized
ridge estimator that allows for both the inclusion of quantitative and
qualitative prior information on the precision matrix via element-wise
penalization and shrinkage (van Wieringen, 2019,
<doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1604374>).  Additionally, the porridge-package
facilitates the ridge penalized estimation of a mixture of Gaussian graphical
models (Aflakparast et al., 2018).  On another note, the package also includes
functionality for ridge-type estimation of the generalized linear model (as
presented in van Wieringen, Binder, 2022, <doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2035231>).")

     "The primary goal of phase I clinical trials is to find the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD).  To reach this objective, we introduce a new design for phase I
clinical trials, the posterior predictive (PoP) design.  The PoP design is an
innovative model-assisted design that is as simply as the conventional
algorithmic designs as its decision rules can be pre-tabulated prior to the
onset of trial, but is of more flexibility of selecting diverse target toxicity
rates and cohort sizes.  The PoP design has desirable properties, such as
coherence and consistency.  Moreover, the PoP design provides better empirical
performance than the BOIN and Keyboard design with respect to high average
probabilities of choosing the MTD and slightly lower risk of treating patients
at subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses.")

allowing for estimates of prevalence to be adjusted for hierarchical sampling

statistics and Polymorphic Information Content are also available.  polysat can
assist the user in estimating the ploidy of samples, and it can estimate allele
frequencies in populations, calculate pairwise or global differentiation
statistics based on those frequencies, and export allele frequencies to SPAGeDi

     "Integrated species distribution modeling is a rising field in quantitative
ecology thanks to significant rises in the quantity of data available, increases
in computational speed and the proven benefits of using such models.  Despite
this, the general software to help ecologists construct such models in an
easy-to-use framework is lacking.  We therefore introduce the R package
PointedSDMs': which provides the tools to help ecologists set up integrated
models and perform inference on them.  There are also functions within the
package to help run spatial cross-validation for model selection, as well as
generic plotting and predicting functions.  An introduction to these methods is
discussed in Issac, Jarzyna, Keil, Dambly, Boersch-Supan, Browning, Freeman,

<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6>) for building ensembles of viable models
via the pattern-oriented modeling (POM) approach (Grimm et al., 2005,
<doi:10.1126/science.1116681>).  The package includes classes for encapsulating
and generating model parameters, and managing the POM workflow.  The workflow
includes: model setup; generating model parameters via Latin hyper-cube sampling
(Iman & Conover, 1980, <doi:10.1080/03610928008827996>); running multiple
sampled model simulations; collating summary results; and validating and
selecting an ensemble of models that best match known patterns.  By default,
model validation and selection utilizes an approximate Bayesian computation
(ABC) approach (Beaumont et al., 2002, <doi:10.1093/genetics/162.4.2025>),
although alternative user-defined functionality could be employed.  The package
includes a spatially explicit demographic population model simulation engine,
which incorporates default functionality for density dependence, correlated
environmental stochasticity, stage-based transitions, and distance-based
dispersal.  The user may customize the simulator by defining functionality for
translocations, harvesting, mortality, and other processes, as well as defining
the sequence order for the simulator processes.  The framework could also be
adapted for use with other model simulators by utilizing its extendable
(inheritable) base classes.")

future probability of the event for two scenarios: one where the event occurred
at a given time and one where the event does not occur.  The package is
consistent with the recent movement to depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret
quantities of interest with the requisite measures of uncertainty.  It is the
first to make it easy for researchers to interpret short- and long-term effects
of explanatory variables in binary autoregressive models, which can have
important implications for the correct interpretation of these models.")

observation weights, logarithmic axis scaling, reordering of factor levels, and
overlaying smoothing curves and median lines.  Plots are drawn using ggplot2'.")

    (description
     "Log-multiplicative association models (LMA) are models for cross-classifications
of categorical variables where interactions are represented by products of
category scale values and an association parameter.  Maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) fails for moderate to large numbers of categorical variables.
The pleLMA package overcomes this limitation of MLE by using pseudo-likelihood
estimation to fit the models to small or large cross-classifications dichotomous
or multi-category variables.  Originally proposed by Besag (1974,
<doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1974.tb00999.x>), pseudo-likelihood estimation takes
large complex models and breaks it down into smaller ones.  Rather than
maximizing the likelihood of the joint distribution of all the variables, a
pseudo-likelihood function, which is the product likelihoods from conditional
distributions, is maximized.  LMA models can be derived from a number of
different frameworks including (but not limited to) graphical models and
uni-dimensional and multi-dimensional item response theory models.  More details
about the models and estimation can be found in the vignette.")

    (description
     "Advances in automated document classification has led to identifying massive
numbers of clinical concepts from handwritten clinical notes.  These high
dimensional clinical concepts can serve as highly informative predictors in
building classification algorithms for identifying patients with different
clinical conditions, commonly referred to as patient phenotyping.  However, from
a planning perspective, it is critical to ensure that enough data is available
for the phenotyping algorithm to obtain a desired classification performance.
This challenge in sample size planning is further exacerbated by the high
dimension of the feature space and the inherent imbalance of the response class.
 Currently available sample size planning methods can be categorized into: (i)
model-based approaches that predict the sample size required for achieving a
desired accuracy using a linear machine learning classifier and (ii) learning
curve-based approaches (Figueroa et al. (2012) <doi:10.1186/1472-6947-12-8>)
that fit an inverse power law curve to pilot data to extrapolate performance.
We develop model-based approaches for imbalanced data with correlated features,
deriving sample size formulas for performance metrics that are sensitive to
class imbalance such as Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve
(AUC) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).  This is done using a two-step
approach where we first perform feature selection using the innovated High
Criticism thresholding method (Hall and Jin (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOS764>),
then determine the sample size by optimizing the two performance metrics.
Further, we develop software in the form of an R package named planningML and an
R Shiny app to facilitate the convenient implementation of the developed
model-based approaches and learning curve approaches for imbalanced data.  We
apply our methods to the problem of phenotyping rare outcomes using the
MIMIC-III electronic health record database.  We show that our developed methods
which relate training data size and performance on AUC and MCC, can predict the
true or observed performance from linear ML classifiers such as LASSO and SVM at
different training data sizes.  Therefore, in high-dimensional classification
analysis with imbalanced data and correlated features, our approach can
efficiently and accurately determine the sample size needed for machine-learning
based classification.")

     "This package provides a tool for inferring kinase activity changes from
phosphoproteomics data.  pKSEA uses kinase-substrate prediction scores to weight
observed changes in phosphopeptide abundance to calculate a phosphopeptide-level
contribution score, then sums up these contribution scores by kinase to obtain a
phosphoproteome-level kinase activity change score (KAC score).  pKSEA then
assesses the significance of changes in predicted substrate abundances for each
kinase using permutation testing.  This results in a permutation score (pKSEA
significance score) reflecting the likelihood of a similarly high or low KAC
from random chance, which can then be interpreted in an analogous manner to an
empirically calculated p-value.  pKSEA contains default databases of
kinase-substrate predictions from NetworKIN (NetworKINPred_db)

pharmacokinetic parameters.  All parameters are considered, but only some of
parameters are used in the model.  Therefore, we need to convert the estimated
parameters to the other parameters after fitting the specific pharmacokinetic
model.  This package is developed to help this converting work.  For more

Among other things, pitchfx data can be used to recreate a baseball's flight
path from a pitcher's hand to home plate.  With pitchRx, one can easily create
animations and interactive 3D scatterplots of the baseball's flight path.
pitchfx data is also commonly used to generate a static plot of baseball
locations at the moment they cross home plate.  These plots, sometimes called
strike-zone plots, can also refer to a plot of event probabilities over the same
region.  pitchRx provides an easy and robust way to generate strike-zone plots
using the ggplot2 package.")

comprise posterior probabilities, an implementation of an
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and PIN decomposition into layers, and
into bad/good components.  Versatile data simulation tools, and trade
classification algorithms are among the supplementary utilities.  The package
provides fast, compact, and precise utilities to tackle the sophisticated,

MODELING: Simulate C3 photosynthesis using the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, Berry
(1980) <doi:10.1007/BF00386231> model as described in Buckley and Diaz-Espejo
(2015) <doi:10.1111/pce.12459>.  It uses units to ensure that parameters are
properly specified and transformed before calculations.  Temperature response
functions get automatically \"baked\" into all parameters based on leaf
temperature following Bernacchi et al. (2002) <doi:10.1104/pp.008250>.  The
package includes boundary layer, cuticular, stomatal, and mesophyll conductances
to CO2, which each can vary on the upper and lower portions of the leaf.  Use
straightforward functions to simulate photosynthesis over environmental
gradients such as Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) and leaf
temperature, or over trait gradients such as CO2 conductance or photochemistry.

    (description
     "Using Electronic Health Record (EHR) is difficult because most of the time the
true characteristic of the patient is not available.  Instead we can retrieve
the International Classification of Disease code related to the disease of
interest or we can count the occurrence of the Unified Medical Language System.
None of them is the true phenotype which needs chart review to identify.
However chart review is time consuming and costly.  PheVis is an algorithm which
is phenotyping (i.e identify a characteristic) at the visit level in an
unsupervised fashion.  It can be used for chronic or acute diseases.  An example
of how to use PheVis is available in the vignette.  Basically there are two

     "Simulation is a critical part of method development and assessment in
quantitative genetics.  PhenotypeSimulator allows for the flexible simulation of
phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant and infinitesimal
genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well as non-genetic
covariate effects, observational noise and additional correlation effects.  The
different phenotype components are combined into a final phenotype while
controlling for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components.
For each effect component, the number of variables, their distribution and the
design of their effect across traits can be customised.  For the simulation of
the genetic effects, external genotype data from a number of standard software
('plink', hapgen2'/ impute2', genome', bimbam', simple text files) can be
imported.  The final simulated phenotypes and its components can be
automatically saved into .rds or .csv files.  In addition, they can be saved in
formats compatible with commonly used genetic association software ('gemma',
bimbam', plink', snptest', LiMMBo').")

best phage cocktail from a phage-bacteria infection network.  It checks
different phage cocktail sizes from 1 to 7 and only stops before if it lyses all
bacteria.  Other option is when users have decided not to obtain a phage
cocktail size higher than a limit value. \"ExhaustivePhi\"--> firstly, it finds
Phi out.  Phi is a formula indicating the necessary phage cocktail size.  Phi
needs nestedness temperature and fill, which are internally calculated.  This
function will only look for the best combination (phage cocktail) with a Phi
size. \"ClusteringSearch\"--> firstly, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering
using Ward's algorithm is calculated for phages.  They will be clustered
according to bacteria lysed by them.  PhageCocktail() chooses how many clusters
are needed in order to select 1 phage per cluster.  Using the phages selected
during the clustering, it checks different phage cocktail sizes from 1 to 7 and
only stops before if it lyses all bacteria.  Other option is when users have
decided not to obtain a phage cocktail size higher than a limit value.
\"ClusteringPhi\"--> firstly, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering using
Ward's algorithm is calculated for phages.  They will be clustered according to
bacteria lysed by them.  PhageCocktail() chooses how many clusters are needed in
order to select 1 phage per cluster.  Once the function has one phage per
cluster, it calculates Phi.  If the number of clusters is less than Phi number,
it will be changed to obtain, as minimum, this quantity of candidates (phages).
Then, it calculates the best combination of Phi phages using those selected
during the clustering with Ward algorithm.  If you use PhageCocktail, please

effects of p-hacking (i.e., manipulation of results within studies to obtain
significant, positive estimates) and traditional publication bias (i.e., the
selective publication of studies with significant, positive results) in
meta-analyses [see Mathur MB (2022). \"Sensitivity analysis for p-hacking in
meta-analyses.\" <doi:10.31219/osf.io/ezjsx>.].  Unlike publication bias alone,
p-hacking that favors significant, positive results (termed \"affirmative\") can
distort the distribution of affirmative results.  To bias-correct results from
affirmative studies would require strong assumptions on the exact nature of
p-hacking.  In contrast, joint p-hacking and publication bias do not distort the
distribution of published nonaffirmative results when there is stringent
p-hacking (e.g., investigators who hack always eventually obtain an affirmative
result) or when there is stringent publication bias (e.g., nonaffirmative
results from hacked studies are never published).  This means that any published
nonaffirmative results are from unhacked studies.  Under these assumptions, RTMA
involves analyzing only the published nonaffirmative results to essentially
impute the full underlying distribution of all results prior to selection due to
p-hacking and/or publication bias.  The package also provides diagnostic plots
described in Mathur (2022).")

<doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1801449>, which allows for subgroup identification
for semi-continuous outcomes by estimating individualized treatment rules.  It
uses a two-part modeling framework to handle semi-continuous data by separately
modeling the positive part of the outcome and an indicator of whether each
outcome is positive, but still results in a single treatment rule.  High
dimensional data is handled with a cooperative lasso penalty, which encourages
the coefficients in the two models to have the same sign.")

test executes thousands of comparisons in a pairwise manner, after a random
shuffling of data into the different groups of study with a prior selection of
the microbiome features with the largest variation among groups.  Previous to
the permutation test itself, data can be normalized according to different
methods proposed to handle microbiome data ('proportions or Anders').  The
median-based differences between groups resulting from the multiple simulations
are fitted to a normal distribution with the aim to calculate their
significance.  A multiple testing correction based on Benjamini-Hochberg method
(fdr) is finally applied to extract the differentially presented features
between groups of your dataset.  LATEST UPDATES: v1.1 and olders incorporates
function to parse COLUMN format; v1.2 and olders incorporates -optimize-
function to maximize evaluation of features with largest inter-class variation;
v1.3 and olders includes the -size.effect- function to perform estimation

     "When working with big data sets, RAM conservation is critically important.
However, it is not always enough to just monitor the size of the objects
created.  So-called \"copy-on-modify\" behavior, characteristic of R, means that
some expressions or functions may require an unexpectedly large amount of RAM
overhead.  For example, replacing a single value in a matrix duplicates that
matrix in the back-end, making this task require twice as much RAM as that used
by the matrix itself.  This package makes it easy to monitor the total and peak
RAM used so that developers can quickly identify and eliminate RAM hungry code.")

on the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), numerical optimization (when
nonlinear moment conditions are employed) and the computation of closed form
solutions (when estimation is based on linear moment conditions).  One-step,
two-step and iterated estimation is available.  For inference and specification
testing, Windmeijer (2005) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.02.005> and doubly

phenotypic descriptors using the machine learning algorithm random forest.  The
methodology for generating these indexes is outlined in Finch et al. (2121)

    (description
     "Phylogenetic comparative methods represent models of continuous trait data
associated with the tips of a phylogenetic tree.  Examples of such models are
Gaussian continuous time branching stochastic processes such as Brownian motion
(BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, which regard the data at the tips of
the tree as an observed (final) state of a Markov process starting from an
initial state at the root and evolving along the branches of the tree.  The
PCMBase R package provides a general framework for manipulating such models.
This framework consists of an application programming interface for specifying
data and model parameters, and efficient algorithms for simulating trait
evolution under a model and calculating the likelihood of model parameters for
an assumed model and trait data.  The package implements a growing collection of
models, which currently includes BM, OU, BM/OU with jumps, two-speed OU as well
as mixed Gaussian models, in which different types of the above models can be
associated with different branches of the tree.  The PCMBase package is limited
to trait-simulation and likelihood calculation of (mixed) Gaussian phylogenetic
models.  The PCMFit package provides functionality for inference of these models
to tree and trait data.  The package web-site
<https://venelin.github.io/PCMBase/> provides access to the documentation and
other resources.")

the PCA decompositions.  The cumulative eigenvalue (CE) plot describes
differences in the variance components (eigenvalues) of the deconstructed
covariance matrices.  The angle plot presents the information loss when moving
from the PCA decomposition of one dataset to the PCA decomposition of the other.
 The chroma plot describes the loading patterns of the two datasets, thereby
presenting the relative weighting and importance of the variables from the
original dataset.")

     "This package provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and operation
of computer models.  It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to
construct and edit a customized graphical user interface ('GUI').  Although our
simplified GUI language depends heavily on the R interface to the Tcl/Tk
package, a user does not need to know Tcl/Tk'.  Examples illustrate models built
with other R packages, including PBSmapping', PBSddesolve', and BRugs'.  A
complete user's guide PBSmodelling-UG.pdf shows how to use this package
effectively.")

R language to include two-dimensional plotting features similar to those
commonly available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).  Embedded C code
speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as finding polygons that
contain specified point events or converting between longitude-latitude and
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  Additionally, we include C++
code developed by Angus Johnson for the Clipper library, data for a global
shoreline, and other data sets in the public domain.  Under the user's R library

guide is offered and should be consulted to use package functions effectively.")

(Bertrand and others 2020, <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa855>).  It allows for
single or joint modeling of, for instance, genes and proteins.  It starts with
the selection of the actors that will be the used in the reverse engineering
upcoming step.  An actor can be included in that selection based on its
differential measurement (for instance gene expression or protein abundance) or
on its time course profile.  Wrappers for actors clustering functions and
cluster analysis are provided.  It also allows reverse engineering of biological
networks taking into account the observed time course patterns of the actors.
Many inference functions are provided and dedicated to get specific features for
the inferred network such as sparsity, robust links, high confidence links or
stable through resampling links.  Some simulation and prediction tools are also
available for cascade networks (Jung and others 2014,
<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt705>).  Example of use with microarray or RNA-Seq

path-specific effects are identified under standard ignorability assumptions.
This package implements an imputation approach to estimating these effects along
with a set of bias formulas for conducting sensitivity analysis (Zhou and
Yamamoto <doi:10.31235/osf.io/2rx6p>).  It contains two main functions: paths()
for estimating path-specific effects and sens() for conducting sensitivity
analysis.  Estimation uncertainty is quantified using the nonparametric
bootstrap.")

     "Enrichment analysis enables researchers to uncover mechanisms underlying a
phenotype.  However, conventional methods for enrichment analysis do not take
into account protein-protein interaction information, resulting in incomplete
conclusions.  pathfindR is a tool for enrichment analysis utilizing active
subnetworks.  The main function identifies active subnetworks in a
protein-protein interaction network using a user-provided list of genes and
associated p values.  It then performs enrichment analyses on the identified
subnetworks, identifying enriched terms (i.e.  pathways or, more broadly, gene
sets) that possibly underlie the phenotype of interest.  pathfindR also offers
functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and identify representative terms
in each cluster, to score the enriched terms per sample and to visualize
analysis results.  The enrichment, clustering and other methods implemented in
pathfindR are described in detail in Ulgen E, Ozisik O, Sezerman OU. 2019.

cforest() provides an implementation of Breiman's random forests.  The function
mob() implements an algorithm for recursive partitioning based on parametric
models (e.g. linear models, GLMs or survival regression) employing parameter
instability tests for split selection.  Extensible functionality for visualizing
tree-structured regression models is available.  The methods are described in

     "This package provides a fast and flexible framework for agglomerative
partitioning.  partition uses an approach called Direct-Measure-Reduce to create
new variables that maintain the user-specified minimum level of information.
Each reduced variable is also interpretable: the original variables map to one
and only one variable in the reduced data set.  partition is flexible, as well:
how variables are selected to reduce, how information loss is measured, and the
way data is reduced can all be customized.  partition is based on the Partition
framework discussed in Millstein et al. (2020) <doi:
10.1093/bioinformatics/btz661>.")

Forensic applications include exclusion probabilities, genotype distributions
and conditional simulations.  Data from the Familias software can be imported

    (description
     "See Miroshnikov and Conlon (2014) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0108425>.  Recent
Bayesian Markov chain Monto Carlo (MCMC) methods have been developed for big
data sets that are too large to be analyzed using traditional statistical
methods.  These methods partition the data into non-overlapping subsets, and
perform parallel independent Bayesian MCMC analyses on the data subsets,
creating independent subposterior samples for each data subset.  These
independent subposterior samples are combined through four functions in this
package, including averaging across subset samples, weighted averaging across
subsets samples, and kernel smoothing across subset samples.  The four functions
assume the user has previously run the Bayesian analysis and has produced the
independent subposterior samples outside of the package; the functions use as
input the array of subposterior samples.  The methods have been demonstrated to
be useful for Bayesian MCMC models including Bayesian logistic regression,
Bayesian Gaussian mixture models and Bayesian hierarchical Poisson-Gamma models.
 The methods are appropriate for Bayesian hierarchical models with
hyperparameters, as long as data values in a single level of the hierarchy are
not split into subsets.")

(CDx) being positive is a key performance parameter for evaluating the clinical

When bridging study patients are enrolled based on CTA assay results,
Binomial-based confidence intervals (CI) may are not appropriate for PPV CI
estimation.  Bootstrap CIs which are not restricted by the Binomial assumption
may be used for PPV CI estimation only when PPV is not 100%.  Bootstrap CI is
not valid when PPV is 100% and becomes a single value of [1, 1].  We proposed a
risk ratio-based method for constructing CI for PPV. By simulation we
illustrated that the coverage probability of the proposed CI is close to the
nominal value even when PPV is high and negative percent agreement (NPA) is
close to 100%.  There is a lack of R package for PPV CI calculation.  we
developed a publicly available R package along with this shiny app to implement
the proposed approach and some other existing methods.")

both fixed effects and random effects econometric models and fits them as
multilevel models (Allison, 2009 <doi:10.4135/9781412993869.d33>; Bell & Jones,

supported via Stan'.  Supports estimation of asymmetric effects models via first

generalization of the difference-in-differences estimator, which does not rely
on the linearity assumption as often done in practice.  Researchers first select
a method of matching each treated observation for a given unit in a particular
time period with control observations from other units in the same time period
that have a similar treatment and covariate history.  These methods include
standard matching methods based on propensity score and Mahalanobis distance, as
well as weighting methods.  Once matching is done, both short-term and long-term
average treatment effects for the treated can be estimated with standard errors.
 The package also offers a visualization technique that allows researchers to
assess the quality of matches by examining the resulting covariate balance.")

the altered JSON-formatted AST back to pandoc'.  This package provides functions
which allow to write such filters in native R code.  Although this package is
inspired by the Python package pandocfilters
<https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/>, it provides additional convenience
functions which make it simple to use the pandocfilters package as a report
generator.  Since pandocfilters inherits most of it's functionality from pandoc
it can create documents in many formats (for more information see

the classical R-squared statistic for a linear model, quantifying the prediction
function's ability to capture the variability of the response.  The second
measure, L-squared, quantifies the prediction function's bias for predicting the
mean regression function.  When used together, they give a complete summary of
the predictive power of a prediction function.  Please refer to Gang Li and
Xiaoyan Wang (2016) <arXiv:1611.03063> for more details.")

individuals cannot be identified---the data from which can conceptually be seen
as a clustered point process (Stevenson, Borchers, and Fewster, 2019

modifying phylogenies containing extinct (i.e.  fossil) lineages.  In
particular, most users are interested in the functions timePaleoPhy,
bin_timePaleoPhy, cal3TimePaleoPhy and bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy, which date
cladograms of fossil taxa using stratigraphic data.  This package also contains
a large number of likelihood functions for estimating sampling and
diversification rates from different types of data available from the fossil
record (e.g. range data, occurrence data, etc).  paleotree users can also
simulate diversification and sampling in the fossil record using the function
simFossilRecord, which is a detailed simulator for branching
birth-death-sampling processes composed of discrete taxonomic units arranged in
ancestor-descendant relationships.  Users can use simFossilRecord to simulate
diversification in incompletely sampled fossil records, under various models of
morphological differentiation (i.e.  the various patterns by which morphotaxa
originate from one another), and with time-dependent, longevity-dependent and/or
diversity-dependent rates of diversification, extinction and sampling.
Additional functions allow users to translate simulated ancestor-descendant data
from simFossilRecord into standard time-scaled phylogenies or unscaled
cladograms that reflect the relationships among taxon units.")

     "This package provides an encapsulated, object-oriented class system for
analyzing bacterial pangenomes.  For a definition of this concept, see Tettelin,
et al. (2005) <doi:10.1073/pnas.0506758102>.  It uses the R6 package as backend.
 It was designed in order to facilitate and speed-up the comparative analysis of
multiple bacterial genomes, standardizing and optimizing routine tasks performed
everyday.  There are a handful of things done everyday when working with
bacterial pangenomes: subset, summarize, extract, visualize and store data.  So,
pagoo is intended to facilitate these tasks as much as possible.  For a
description of the implemented data structure and methods, see Ferres & Iraola

variance normalization, and can be used to identify subpopulations and run
differential expression within individual samples.  pagoda2 was written to
rapidly process modern large-scale scRNAseq datasets of approximately 1e6 cells.
 The companion web application allows users to explore which gene expression
patterns form the different subpopulations within your data.  The package also
serves as the primary method for preprocessing data for conos,

paper).  The algorithm here is designed to allow users to define linear
constraints (either equality or inequality constraints) and use a penalized
regression approach to solve the constrained problem.  The functions here are
used specifically for constraints with the lasso formulation, but the method
described in the PaC paper can be used for a variety of scenarios.  In addition
to the simple examples included here with the corresponding functions, complete
code to entirely reproduce the results of the paper is available online through
