     "Fresh biomass determination is the key to evaluating crop genotypes response to
diverse input and stress conditions and forms the basis for calculating net
primary production.  However, as conventional phenotyping approaches for
measuring fresh biomass is time-consuming, laborious and destructive,
image-based phenotyping methods are being widely used now.  In the image-based
approach, the fresh weight of the above-ground part of the plant depends on the
projected area.  For determining the projected area, the visual image of the
plant is converted into the grayscale image by simply averaging the Red(R),
Green (G) and Blue (B) pixel values.  Grayscale image is then converted into a
binary image using Otsuâs thresholding method Otsu, N. (1979)
<doi:10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076> to separate plant area from the background
(image segmentation).  The segmentation process was accomplished by selecting
the pixels with values over the threshold value belonging to the plant region
and other pixels to the background region.  The resulting binary image consists
of white and black pixels representing the plant and background regions.
Finally, the number of pixels inside the plant region was counted and converted
to square centimetres (cm2) using the reference object (any object whose actual
area is known previously) to get the projected area.  After that, the projected
area is used as input to the machine learning model (Linear Model, Artificial
Neural Network, and Support Vector Regression) to determine the plant's fresh
weight.")

tests and estimate various characteristics based on the epistemic bootstrap.
The package also includes real-life datasets of epistemic fuzzy triangular and

used for both the real (i.e. \"crisp\") and fuzzy data.  The main aim of the
algorithms implemented in this package is to overcome a problem with repetition
of a few distinct values and to create fuzzy numbers, which are \"similar\" (but
not the same) to values from the initial sample.  To do this, different
characteristics of triangular/trapezoidal numbers are kept (like the value, the
ambiguity, etc., see Grzegorzewski et al. <doi:10.2991/eusflat-19.2019.68>,

new class of distances between fuzzy numbers\") and estimation of the p-value of

efficacy endpoint for a fixed period of time.  Consequently, at the time when
the last enrolled participant completes their follow-up, the number of observed
endpoints is a random variable.  Assuming data collected through an interim
timepoint, simulation-based estimation and inferential procedures in the
standard right-censored failure time analysis framework are conducted for the
distribution of the number of endpoints--in total as well as by treatment
arm--at the end of the follow-up period.  The future (i.e., yet unobserved)
enrollment, endpoint, and dropout times are generated according to mechanisms
specified in the @code{simTrial()} function in the @code{seqDesign} package.  A
Bayesian model for the endpoint rate, offering the option to specify a robust
mixture prior distribution, is used for generating future data (see the vignette
for details).  Inference can be restricted to participants who received
treatment according to the protocol and are observed to be at risk for the
endpoint at a specified timepoint.  Plotting functions are provided for
graphical display of results.")

are constructed using (high-dimensional) omics variables only.  The
leaf-node-specific regression models are estimated using the penalized
likelihood including a standard ridge (L2) penalty and a fusion penalty that
links the leaf-node-specific regression models to one another.  The intercepts
of the leaf nodes reflect the effects of the clinical variables and are left
unpenalized.  The tree, fitted with the clinical variables only, should be
constructed outside of the package with the rpart R package.  See Goedhart and

     "This package performs functional regression, and some related approaches, for
intensive longitudinal data (see the book by Walls & Schafer, 2006, Models for
Intensive Longitudinal Data, Oxford) when such data is not necessarily observed
on an equally spaced grid of times.  The approach generally follows the ideas of
Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu, Caffo, and Reich
(2011)<DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.10007> and the approach taken in their sample code,
but with some modifications to make it more feasible to use with long rather
than wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal and potentially
random measurement times.  It also allows easy plotting of the correlation
between the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of time, which can
add additional insights on how to interpret a functional regression.
Additionally, it also provides several permutation tests for the significance of
the functional predictor.  The heuristic interpretation of ``time is used to
describe the index of the functional predictor, but the same methods can equally
be used for another unidimensional continuous index, such as space along a
north-south axis.  Note that most of the functionality of this package has been
superseded by added features after 2016 in the pfr function by Jonathan Gellar,
Mathew W. @code{McLean}, Jeff Goldsmith, and Fabian Scheipl, in the refund
package built by Jeff Goldsmith and co-authors and maintained by Julia Wrobel.
The development of the funreg package in 2015 and 2016 was part of a research

limits and estimation methods (i.e.  exact or approximate) based on
Spiegelhalter (2005) <doi:10.1002/sim.1970>.  Additional routines for returning
scored unit level data according to a set of specifications is also implemented
for convenience.  Specifically, both a categorical and a continuous score
variable is returned to the sample data frame, which identifies which
observations are deemed extreme or in control.  Typically, such variables are
useful as stratifications or covariates in further exploratory analyses.
Lastly, the plotting routine returns a base funnel plot ('ggplot2'), which can
also be tailored.")

Chiaromonte (2023) \"Probabilistic K-means with Local Alignment for Clustering
and Motif Discovery in Functional Data\" <doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2156522> is a
probabilistic K-means algorithm that leverages local alignment and fuzzy
clustering to identify recurring patterns (candidate functional motifs) across
and within curves, allowing different portions of the same curve to belong to
different clusters.  It includes a family of distances and a normalization to
discover various motif types and learns motif lengths in a data-driven manner.
It can also be used for local clustering of misaligned data.  Di Iorio, Cremona,
and Chiaromonte (2023) \"@code{funBIalign}: A Hierarchical Algorithm for
Functional Motif Discovery Based on Mean Squared Residue Scores\"
<doi:10.48550/@code{arXiv.2306.04254>} applies hierarchical agglomerative
clustering with a functional generalization of the Mean Squared Residue Score to
identify motifs of a specified length in curves.  This deterministic method
includes a small set of user-tunable parameters.  Both algorithms are suitable
for single curves or sets of curves.  The package also includes a flexible
function to simulate functional data with embedded motifs, allowing users to

statistic offers a new effect size measure for the strength of functional
dependency, a better alternative to conditional entropy in many aspects.  For
continuous data, these tests offer an advantage over regression analysis when a

a novel means to assess directional dependency not possible with symmetrical
Pearson's chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests.")

is for one-hot encoded design matrices that should be used in linear models to
ensure that significant associations can be correctly interpreted.  However,
@code{fullRankMatrix} can be applied to any matrix to make it full rank.  It
removes columns with only 0's, merges duplicated columns and discovers linearly
dependent columns and replaces them with linearly independent columns that span
the space of the original columns.  Columns are renamed to reflect those
modifications.  This results in a full rank matrix that can be used as a design
matrix in linear models.  The algorithm and some functions are inspired by Kuhn,

the method is to determine the weights of criteria such that the deviation from
full consistency is minimized.  Users provide a character vector specifying the
ranking of each criterion according to its significance, starting from the
criterion expected to have the highest weight to the least significant one.
Additionally, users provide a numeric vector specifying the priority values for
each criterion.  The comparison is made with respect to the first-ranked (most
significant) criterion.  The function returns the optimized weights for each
criterion (summing to 1), the comparative priority (Phi) values, the
mathematical transitivity condition (w) value, and the minimum deviation from
full consistency (DFC).")

     "Extracts features from biological sequences.  It contains most features which
are presented in related work and also includes features which have never been
introduced before.  It extracts numerous features from nucleotide and peptide
sequences.  Each feature converts the input sequences to discrete numbers in
order to use them as predictors in machine learning models.  There are many
features and information which are hidden inside a sequence.  Utilizing the
package, users can convert biological sequences to discrete models based on
chosen properties.  References: @code{iLearn} Z. Chen et al. (2019)

such that the design at each size has good space-filling properties.  Two
methods target the minimum pairwise distance criterion and generate maximin

One method targets the maximum hole size criterion and uses a heuristic to
generate what is closer to a minimax design.")

     "Evaluation Tools for Assessing Climate Adaptation of Fruit Tree Species")
    (description
     "Climate is a critical component limiting growing range of plant species, which
also determines cultivar adaptation to a region.  The evaluation of climate
influence on fruit production is critical for decision-making in the design
stage of orchards and vineyards and in the evaluation of the potential
consequences of future climate.  Bio- climatic indices and plant phenology are
commonly used to describe the suitability of climate for growing quality fruit
and to provide temporal and spatial information about regarding ongoing and
future changes.  fruclimadapt streamlines the assessment of climate adaptation
and the identification of potential risks for grapevines and fruit trees.
Procedures in the package allow to i) downscale daily meteorological variables
to hourly values (Forster et al (2016) <doi:10.5194/gmd-9-2315-2016>), ii)
estimate chilling and forcing heat accumulation (Miranda et al (2019)
<https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/sites/default/files/fg30_mp5_phenology_critical_temperatures.pdf>),
iii) estimate plant phenology (Schwartz (2012) <doi:10.1007/978-94-007-6925-0>),
iv) calculate bioclimatic indices to evaluate fruit tree and grapevine
adaptation (e.g. Badr et al (2017) <doi:10.3354/cr01532>), v) estimate the
incidence of weather-related disorders in fruits (e.g. Snyder and de Melo-Abreu
(2005, ISBN:92-5-105328-6) and vi) estimate plant water requirements (Allen et
al (1998, ISBN:92-5-104219-5)).")

     "This package provides a tool for spatial/spatio-temporal modelling and
prediction with large datasets.  The approach models the field, and hence the
covariance function, using a set of basis functions.  This fixed-rank
basis-function representation facilitates the modelling of big data, and the
method naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic covariance functions.
Discretisation of the spatial domain into so-called basic areal units (BAUs)
facilitates the use of observations with varying support (i.e., both
point-referenced and areal supports, potentially simultaneously), and prediction
over arbitrary user-specified regions. `FRK` also supports inference over
various manifolds, including the 2D plane and 3D sphere, and it provides helper
functions to model, fit, predict, and plot with relative ease.  Version 2.0.0
and above also supports the modelling of non-Gaussian data (e.g., Poisson,
binomial, negative-binomial, gamma, and inverse-Gaussian) by employing a
generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework.  Zammit-Mangion and Cressie
<doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i04> describe `FRK` in a Gaussian setting, and detail its
use of basis functions and BAUs, while Sainsbury-Dale, Zammit-Mangion, and
Cressie <doi:10.18637/jss.v108.i10> describe `FRK` in a non-Gaussian setting;
two vignettes are available that summarise these papers and provide additional
examples.")

Typically they contain time-series of three-dimensional brain scans acquired by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  They can also contain vertex-wise measures of
surface morphometry data.  The MGH format is named after the Massachusetts
General Hospital, and the MGZ format is a compressed version of the same format.
 2) @code{FreeSurfer} morphometry data files in binary curv format.  These
contain vertex-wise surface measures, i.e., one scalar value for each vertex of
a brain surface mesh.  These are typically values like the cortical thickness or
brain surface area at each vertex.  3) Annotation file format.  This contains a
brain surface parcellation derived from a cortical atlas.  4) Surface file
format.  Contains a brain surface mesh, given by a list of vertices and a list

     "Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems for Classification and Regression Tasks")
    (description
     "An implementation of various learning algorithms based on fuzzy rule-based
systems (FRBSs) for dealing with classification and regression tasks.  Moreover,
it allows to construct an FRBS model defined by human experts.  FRBSs are based
on the concept of fuzzy sets, proposed by Zadeh in 1965, which aims at
representing the reasoning of human experts in a set of IF-THEN rules, to handle
real-life problems in, e.g., control, prediction and inference, data mining,
bioinformatics data processing, and robotics.  FRBSs are also known as fuzzy
inference systems and fuzzy models.  During the modeling of an FRBS, there are
two important steps that need to be conducted: structure identification and
parameter estimation.  Nowadays, there exists a wide variety of algorithms to
generate fuzzy IF-THEN rules automatically from numerical data, covering both
steps.  Approaches that have been used in the past are, e.g., heuristic
procedures, neuro-fuzzy techniques, clustering methods, genetic algorithms,
squares methods, etc.  Furthermore, in this version we provide a universal
framework named @code{frbsPMML}', which is adopted from the Predictive Model
Markup Language (PMML), for representing FRBS models.  PMML is an XML-based
language to provide a standard for describing models produced by data mining and
machine learning algorithms.  Therefore, we are allowed to export and import an
FRBS model to/from @code{frbsPMML}'.  Finally, this package aims to implement
the most widely used standard procedures, thus offering a standard package for
FRBS modeling to the R community.")

estimation on the hazard function but also a parametric estimation can be fit
using this R package: 1) A shared frailty model (with gamma or log-normal
frailty distribution) and Cox proportional hazard model.  Clustered and
recurrent survival times can be studied.  2) Additive frailty models for
proportional hazard models with two correlated random effects (intercept random
effect with random slope).  3) Nested frailty models for hierarchically
clustered data (with 2 levels of clustering) by including two iid gamma random
effects.  4) Joint frailty models in the context of the joint modelling for
recurrent events with terminal event for clustered data or not.  A joint frailty
model for two semi-competing risks and clustered data is also proposed.  5)
Joint general frailty models in the context of the joint modelling for recurrent
events with terminal event data with two independent frailty terms.  6) Joint
Nested frailty models in the context of the joint modelling for recurrent events
with terminal event, for hierarchically clustered data (with two levels of
clustering) by including two iid gamma random effects.  7) Multivariate joint
frailty models for two types of recurrent events and a terminal event.  8) Joint
models for longitudinal data and a terminal event.  9) Trivariate joint models
for longitudinal data, recurrent events and a terminal event.  10) Joint frailty
models for the validation of surrogate endpoints in multiple randomized clinical
trials with failure-time and/or longitudinal endpoints with the possibility to
use a mediation analysis model.  11) Conditional and Marginal two-part joint
models for longitudinal semicontinuous data and a terminal event.  12) Joint
frailty-copula models for the validation of surrogate endpoints in multiple
randomized clinical trials with failure-time endpoints.  13) Generalized shared
and joint frailty models for recurrent and terminal events.  Proportional
hazards (PH), additive hazard (AH), proportional odds (PO) and probit models are
available in a fully parametric framework.  For PH and AH models, it is possible
to consider type-varying coefficients and flexible semiparametric hazard
function.  Prediction values are available (for a terminal event or for a new
recurrent event).  Left-truncated (not for Joint model), right-censored data,
interval-censored data (only for Cox proportional hazard and shared frailty
model) and strata are allowed.  In each model, the random effects have the gamma
or normal distribution.  Now, you can also consider time-varying covariates
effects in Cox, shared and joint frailty models (1-5).  The package includes
concordance measures for Cox proportional hazards models and for shared frailty
models.  14) Competing Joint Frailty Model: A single type of recurrent event and
two terminal events.  15) functions to compute power and sample size for four
Gamma-frailty-based designs: Shared Frailty Models, Nested Frailty Models, Joint
Frailty Models, and General Joint Frailty Models.  Each design includes two
primary functions: a power function, which computes power given a specified
sample size; and a sample size function, which computes the required sample size
to achieve a specified power.  Moreover, the package can be used with its shiny
application, in a local mode or by following the link below.")

    (description
     "This package provides a collection of user-friendly functions for assessing and
visualizing fragility of individual studies (Walsh et al., 2014
<doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.10.019>; Lin, 2021 <doi:10.1111/jep.13428>),
conventional pairwise meta-analyses (Atal et al., 2019
<doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.03.012>), and network meta-analyses of multiple
treatments with binary outcomes (Xing et al., 2020
<doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.07.003>).  The included functions are designed to:
1) calculate the fragility index (i.e., the minimal event status modifications
that can alter the significance or non-significance of the original result) and
fragility quotient (i.e., fragility index divided by sample size) at a specific
significance level; 2) give the cases of event status modifications for altering
the result's significance or non-significance and visualize these cases; 3)
visualize the trend of statistical significance as event status is modified; 4)
efficiently derive fragility indexes and fragility quotients at multiple
significance levels, and visualize the relationship between these fragility
measures against the significance levels; and 5) calculate fragility indexes and
fragility quotients of multiple datasets (e.g., a collection of clinical trials
or meta-analyses) and produce plots of their overall distributions.  The outputs
from these functions may inform the robustness of clinical results in terms of
statistical significance and aid the interpretation of fragility measures.  The
usage of this package is illustrated in Lin et al. (2023
<doi:10.1016/j.ajog.2022.08.053>) and detailed in Lin and Chu (2022

testing fuzzy hypotheses based on fuzzy data, see Parchami et al. (2012)
<doi:10.1007/s00362-010-0353-2>.  In all cases, the fuzziness of data or / and
the fuzziness of the boundary of null fuzzy hypothesis transported via the
p-value function and causes to produce the fuzzy p-value.  If the p-value is
fuzzy, it is more appropriate to consider a fuzzy significance level for the
problem.  Therefore, the comparison of the fuzzy p-value and the fuzzy
significance level is evaluated by a fuzzy ranking method in this package.")

     "This data contains a large variety of information on players and their current
attributes on Fantasy Premier League <https://fantasy.premierleague.com/>.  In
particular, it contains a `next_gw_points` (next gameweek points) value for each
player given their attributes in the current week.  Rows represent
player-gameweeks, i.e.  for each player there is a row for each gameweek.  This
makes the data suitable for modelling a player's next gameweek points, given
attributes such as form, total points, and cost at the current gameweek.  This
data can therefore be used to create Fantasy Premier League bots that may use a
machine learning algorithm and a linear programming solver (for example) to
return the best possible transfers and team to pick for each gameweek, thereby
fully automating the decision making process in Fantasy Premier League.  This
function simply supplies the required data for such a task.")

to a cluster according to their probability of membership under the constraint
that the product of the probability and the distance of each point to any
cluster center is a constant.  PD-clustering is a flexible method that can be
used with elliptical clusters, outliers, or noisy data.  PDQ is an extension of
the algorithm for clusters of different sizes.  GPDC and TPDC use a
dissimilarity measure based on densities.  Factor PD-clustering (FPDC) is a
factor clustering method that involves a linear transformation of variables and
a cluster optimizing the PD-clustering criterion.  It works on high-dimensional

system of functions to estimate tree volume and phytomass components (stem,
branches, stool).  The estimates of the 2005 Italian forest inventory
(<https://www.inventarioforestale.org/it/>) are based on these functions.  The
study documents the domain of applicability of each function and the equations
to quantify estimates accuracies for individual estimates as well as for
aggregated estimates.  This package makes the functions available in the R
environment.  Version 2 exposes two distinct functions for individual and
summary estimates.  To facilitate access to the functions, tree species
identification is now based on EPPO species codes (<https://data.eppo.int/>).")

     "Supervised, multivariate, and non-parametric discretization algorithm based on
tree ensembles learning and moment matching optimization.  This version of the
algorithm relies on random forest algorithm to learn a large set of split points
that conserves the relationship between attributes and the target class, and on
moment matching optimization to transform this set into a reduced number of cut
points matching as well as possible statistical properties of the initial set of
split points.  For each attribute to be discretized, the set S of its related
split points extracted through random forest is mapped to a reduced set C of cut
points of size k.  This mapping relies on minimizing, for each continuous
attribute to be discretized, the distance between the four first moments of S
and the four first moments of C subject to some constraints.  This non-linear
optimization problem is performed using k values ranging from 2 to max_splits',
and the best solution returned correspond to the value k which optimum solution
is the lowest one over the different realizations. @code{ForestDisc} is a
generalization of RFDisc discretization method initially proposed by Berrado and
Runger (2009) <doi:10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069327>, and improved by Berrado et al.

    (description
     "This package provides a tool to create hydroclimate scenarios, stress test
systems and visualize system performance in scenario-neutral climate change
impact assessments.  Scenario-neutral approaches stress-test the performance of
a modelled system by applying a wide range of plausible hydroclimate conditions
(see Brown & Wilby (2012) <doi:10.1029/2012EO410001> and Prudhomme et al. (2010)
<doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.06.043>).  These approaches allow the identification
of hydroclimatic variables that affect the vulnerability of a system to
hydroclimate variation and change.  This tool enables the generation of
perturbed time series using a range of approaches including simple scaling of
observed time series (e.g. Culley et al. (2016) <doi:10.1002/2015WR018253>) and
stochastic simulation of perturbed time series via an inverse approach (see Guo
et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.025>).  It incorporates
Richardson-type weather generator model configurations documented in Richardson
(1981) <doi:10.1029/WR017i001p00182>, Richardson and Wright (1984), as well as
latent variable type model configurations documented in Bennett et al. (2018)
<doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.043>, Rasmussen (2013) <doi:10.1002/wrcr.20164>,
Bennett et al. (2019) <doi:10.5194/hess-23-4783-2019> to generate hydroclimate
variables on a daily basis (e.g. precipitation, temperature, potential
evapotranspiration) and allows a variety of different hydroclimate variable
properties, herein called attributes, to be perturbed.  Options are included for
the easy integration of existing system models both internally in R and
externally for seamless stress-testing'.  A suite of visualization options for
the results of a scenario-neutral analysis (e.g. plotting performance spaces and
overlaying climate projection information) are also included.  Version 1.0 of
this package is described in Bennett et al. (2021)
<doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.104999>.  As further developments in
scenario-neutral approaches occur the tool will be updated to incorporate these
advances.")

and one of its tuning parameters, the truncation parameter, trades off a size
and power.  Lazarus, Lewis, and Stock (2021)<doi:10.3982/ECTA15404>
theoretically characterize the size-power frontier for the Gaussian multivariate
location model. @code{ForeComp} computes and visualizes the finite-sample
size-power frontier of the Diebold-Mariano test based on fixed-b asymptotics
together with the Bartlett kernel.  To compute the finite-sample size and power,
it works with the best approximating ARMA process to the given dataset.  It
informs the user how their choice of the truncation parameter performs and how
robust the testing outcomes are.")

zero-inflated Skellam.  It supports both maximum likelihood estimation (MLE, for
static models only) and Bayesian inference.  For Bayesian methods, it
incorporates several techniques: MCMC sampling with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,
variational inference using either the Pathfinder algorithm or Automatic
Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI), and the Laplace approximation.
The package compiles all the @code{CmdStan} models once during installation
using the instantiate package.  The model construction relies on the most

proposed by Smyth (2004) <doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1027>.  LOESS local regression
and empirical Bayesian method are used to estimate gene specific prior degrees
of freedom and prior variance based on average gene intensity levels.  The
posterior residual variance in the denominator is a weighted average of prior
and residual variance and the weights are prior degrees of freedom and residual
variance degrees of freedom.  The degrees of freedom of the moderated
t-statistic is simply the sum of prior and residual variance degrees of freedom.")

     "Ecosystem Gas Fluxes Calculations for Closed Loop Chamber Setup")
    (description
     "Toolbox to process raw data from closed loop flux chamber (or tent) setups into
ecosystem gas fluxes usable for analysis.  It goes from a data frame of gas
concentration over time (which can contain several measurements) and a meta data
file indicating which measurement was done when, to a data frame of ecosystem
gas fluxes including quality diagnostics.  Organized with one function per step,
maximizing user flexibility and backwards compatibility.  Different models to
estimate the fluxes from the raw data are available: exponential as described in
Zhao et al (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.08.022>, exponential as
described in Hutchinson and Mosier (1981)
<doi:10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500020017x>, quadratic, and linear.  Other
functions include quality assessment, plotting for visual check, calculation of
fluxes based on the setup specific parameters (chamber size, plot area, ...),
gross primary production and transpiration rate calculation, and light response
curves.")

     "Specialized solvers for combinatorial optimization problems in the Subset Sum
family.  The solvers differ from the mainstream in the options of (i)
restricting subset size, (ii) bounding subset elements, (iii) mining real-value
multisets with predefined subset sum errors, (iv) finding one or more subsets in
limited time.  A novel algorithm for mining the one-dimensional Subset Sum
induced algorithms for the multi-Subset Sum and the multidimensional Subset Sum.
 The multi-threaded framework for the latter offers exact algorithms to the
multidimensional Knapsack and the Generalized Assignment problems.  Historical
updates include (a) renewed implementation of the multi-Subset Sum,
multidimensional Knapsack and Generalized Assignment solvers; (b) availability
of bounding solution space in the multidimensional Subset Sum; (c) fundamental
data structure and architectural changes for enhanced cache locality and better
chance of SIMD vectorization; (d) option of mapping floating-point instance to
compressed 64-bit integer instance with user-controlled precision loss, which
could yield substantial speedup due to the dimension reduction and efficient
compressed integer arithmetic via bit-manipulations; (e) distributed computing
infrastructure for multidimensional subset sum; (f) arbitrary-precision
zero-margin-of-error multidimensional Subset Sum accelerated by a simplified
Bloom filter.  The package contains a copy of @code{xxHash} from
<https://github.com/Cyan4973/@code{xxHash>}.  Package vignette

     "This package provides functionality to perform machine-learning-based modeling
in a computation pipeline.  Its functions contain the basic steps of
machine-learning-based knowledge discovery workflows, including model training
and optimization, model evaluation, and model testing.  To perform these tasks,
the package builds heavily on existing machine-learning packages, such as caret
<https://github.com/topepo/caret/> and associated packages.  The package can
train multiple models, optimize model hyperparameters by performing a grid
search or a random search, and evaluates model performance by different metrics.
 Models can be validated either on a test data set, or in case of a small sample
size by k-fold cross validation or repeated bootstrapping.  It also allows for
0-Hypotheses generation by performing permutation experiments.  Additionally, it
offers methods of model interpretation and item categorization to identify the
most informative features from a high dimensional data space.  The functions of
this package can easily be integrated into computation pipelines (e.g. nextflow
<https://www.nextflow.io/>) and hereby improve scalability, standardization, and
re-producibility in the context of machine-learning.")

this exchangeability assumption, allowing the user to specify the feature
dependencies by hand as long as features can be grouped into disjoint
independent sets.  This package also allows users to test a dual hypothesis,
which is, given that the sample is exchangeable, does a proposed grouping of the
features into disjoint sets also produce statistically independent sets of
features? See Aw, Spence and Song (2023) for the accompanying paper.")

n, finite fields, the rational, p-adic, real, and complex numbers) as well as
matrices and polynomials over rings.  FLINT implements midpoint-radius interval
arithmetic, also known as ball arithmetic, in the real and complex numbers,
enabling computation in arbitrary precision with rigorous propagation of
rounding and other errors; see Johansson (2017) <doi:10.1109/TC.2017.2690633>.
Finally, FLINT provides ball arithmetic implementations of many special
mathematical functions, with high coverage of reference works such as the NIST
Digital Library of Mathematical Functions <https://dlmf.nist.gov/>.  The R
interface defines S4 classes, generic functions, and methods for representation
and basic operations as well as plain R functions mirroring and vectorizing

variance-inflated beta (Di Brisco, A. M., Migliorati, S., Ongaro, A. (2020)

handle the presence of zero/one values (Di Brisco, A. M., Migliorati, S. (2020)

models are the flexible beta-binomial (Ascari, R., Migliorati, S. (2021)

miss-specifying the response function results in biased estimates.  Therefore in
Spiegel et al. (2017) <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9799-6> we propose to estimate the
response function jointly with the covariate effects.  This package provides the
underlying functions to estimate these generalized additive models with flexible
response functions.  The estimation is based on an iterative algorithm.  In the
outer loop the response function is estimated, while in the inner loop the
covariate effects are determined.  For the response function a strictly monotone
P-spline is used while the covariate effects are estimated based on a modified
Fisher-Scoring algorithm.  Overall the estimation relies on the mgcv'-package.")

which can deal with NAs.  It is entirely written in C and relies fully on linear
algebra subroutines contained in BLAS and LAPACK. Due to the speed of the
filter, the fitting of high-dimensional linear state space models to large
datasets becomes possible.  This package also contains a plot function for the
visualization of the state vector and graphical diagnostics of the residuals.")

     "Generates predictive distributions based on calibrating priors for various
commonly used statistical models, including models with predictors.  Routines
for densities, probabilities, quantiles, random deviates and the parameter
posterior are provided.  The predictions are generated from the Bayesian
prediction integral, with priors chosen to give good reliability (also known as
calibration).  For homogeneous models, the prior is set to the right Haar prior,
giving predictions which are exactly reliable.  As a result, in repeated
testing, the frequencies of out-of-sample outcomes and the probabilities from
the predictions agree.  For other models, the prior is chosen to give good
reliability.  Where possible, the Bayesian prediction integral is solved
exactly.  Where exact solutions are not possible, the Bayesian prediction
integral is solved using the Datta-Mukerjee-Ghosh-Sweeting (DMGS) asymptotic
expansion.  Optionally, the prediction integral can also be solved using
posterior samples generated using Paul Northrop's ratio of uniforms sampling
package ('rust').  Results are also generated based on maximum likelihood, for
comparison purposes.  Various model selection diagnostics and testing routines
are included.  Based on \"Reducing reliability bias in assessments of extreme

fitbitr is to make interfacing with the Fitbit API as streamlined as possible,
to make it simple for R users of all backgrounds and comfort levels to analyze
their Fitbit data and do whatever they want with it! Currently, fitbitr includes
methods for pulling data on activity, sleep, and heart rate, but this list is
likely to grow in the future as the package gains more traction and more
requests for new methods to be implemented come in.  You can find details on the
Fitbit API at <https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/>.")

essential for evaluating their nutritional value and for making informed dietary
choices.  The primary components typically analyzed include; moisture/ water in
foods, crude protein, crude fat/ lipid, total ash, fiber and carbohydrates
AOAC(2005,ISBN:0-935584-77-3).  In case of fish, shellfish and its products, the
proximate composition consists of four primary constituents - water, protein,
fat, and ash (mostly minerals).  Fish exhibit significant variation in their
chemical makeup based on age, sex, environment, and season, both within the same
species and between individual fish.  There is minimal fluctuation in the
content of ash and protein.  The lipid concentration varies remarkably and is
inversely correlated with the water content.  In case of fish, carbohydrates are
present in minor quantity so that are quantified by subtracting total of other
components from 100 to get percentage of carbohydrates.")

for example, when selecting a small number of most (or least) efficacious
treatments from a large number of alternative treatments as well as when
identifying subsets of the population who benefit (or are harmed by) a treatment
of interest.  The method adapts the Support Vector Machine classifier by placing
separate LASSO constraints over the pre-treatment parameters and causal
heterogeneity parameters of interest.  This allows for the qualitative
distinction between causal and other parameters, thereby making the variable
selection suitable for the exploration of causal heterogeneity.  The package
also contains a class of functions, @code{CausalANOVA}, which estimates the
average marginal interaction effects (AMIEs) by a regularized ANOVA as proposed
by Egami and Imai (2019).  It contains a variety of regularization techniques to
facilitate analysis of large factorial experiments.")

    (description
     "Routines for estimating tree fiber (tracheid) length distributions in the
standing tree based on increment core samples.  Two types of data can be used
with the package, increment core data measured by means of an optical fiber
analyzer (OFA), e.g. such as the Kajaani Fiber Lab, or measured by microscopy.
Increment core data analyzed by OFAs consist of the cell lengths of both cut and
uncut fibres (tracheids) and fines (such as ray parenchyma cells) without being
able to identify which cells are cut or if they are fines or fibres.  The
microscopy measured data consist of the observed lengths of the uncut fibres in
the increment core.  A censored version of a mixture of the fine and fiber
length distributions is proposed to fit the OFA data, under distributional
assumptions (Svensson et al., 2006) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9469.2006.00501.x>.  The
package offers two choices for the assumptions of the underlying density
functions of the true fiber (fine) lenghts of those fibers (fines) that at least
partially appear in the increment core, being the generalized gamma and the log
normal densities.")

testing, described by Langsrud (2005) <doi:10.1007/s11222-005-4789-5>, is used
to compute adjusted single response p-values according to familywise error rates

appendix of Moen et al. (2005) <doi:10.1128/AEM.71.4.2086-2094.2005>.
Unbalanced designs are handled by Type II sums of squares as argued in Langsrud
(2003) <doi:10.1023/A:1023260610025>.  Furthermore, the Type II philosophy is
extended to continuous design variables as described in Langsrud et al. (2007)

governance and management practices are very essential to ensure the
sustainability of the marine resources.  A widely accepted resource management
strategy towards this is to derive sustainable fish harvest levels based on the
status of marine fish stock.  Various fish stock assessment models that describe
the biomass dynamics using time series data on fish catch and fishing effort are
generally used for this purpose.  In the scenario of complex multi-species
marine fishery in which different species are caught by a number of fishing
gears and each gear harvests a number of species make it difficult to obtain the
fishing effort corresponding to each fish species.  Since the capacity of the
gears varies, the effort made to catch a resource cannot be considered as the
sum of efforts expended by different fishing gears.  This necessitates
standardisation of fishing effort in unit base.")

     "This method is a new class of model selection strategies, for mixed model
selection, which includes linear and generalized linear mixed models.  The idea
involves a procedure to isolate a subgroup of what are known as correct models
(of which the optimal model is a member).  This is accomplished by constructing
a statistical fence, or barrier, to carefully eliminate incorrect models.  Once
the fence is constructed, the optimal model is selected from among those within
the fence according to a criterion which can be made flexible.  References: 1.

package plm by Croissant and Millo (2008) <doi:10.18637/jss.v027.i02>.  In FEIS
models, data are not only person demeaned like in conventional FE models, but
detrended by the predicted individual slope of each person or group.  Estimation
is performed by applying least squares @code{lm()} to the transformed data.  For
more details on FEIS models see Bruederl and Ludwig (2015, ISBN:1446252442);

models with a fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average (FARIMA)
model in the mean and a long-memory model in the variance, and semiparametric
volatility model extensions.  Parametric models and parametric model parts are

counterfactual methods, as well as other modern DID estimators.  It is designed
for causal panel analysis with binary treatments under the parallel trends
assumption.  The package supports scenarios where treatments can switch on and
off and allows for limited carryover effects.  It includes several imputation
estimators, such as Gsynth (Xu 2017), linear factor models, and the matrix
completion method.  Detailed methodology is described in Liu, Wang, and Xu
(2024) <doi:10.48550/@code{arXiv.2107.00856>} and Chiu et al. (2025)
<doi:10.48550/@code{arXiv.2309.15983>}.  Optionally integrates with the
\"@code{HonestDiDFEct}\" package for sensitivity analyses compatible with
imputation estimators. \"@code{HonestDiDFEct}\" is not on CRAN but can be obtained
from <https://github.com/lzy318/@code{HonestDiDFEct>}.")

 The package implements methods for two types of test statistics and their
p-values: (a) binomial test on if two independent Poisson distributions have the
same means, (b) Fisher's exact test on if the conditional distribution is the
same as the marginal distribution for two binomial distributions, or on if two

     "Implementation of the Interval Testing Procedure for functional data in
different frameworks (i.e., one or two-population frameworks, functional linear
models) by means of different basis expansions (i.e., B-spline, Fourier, and
phase-amplitude Fourier).  The current version of the package requires
functional data evaluated on a uniform grid; it automatically projects each
function on a chosen functional basis; it performs the entire family of
multivariate tests; and, finally, it provides the matrix of the p-values of the
previous tests and the vector of the corrected p-values.  The functional basis,
the coupled or uncoupled scenario, and the kind of test can be chosen by the
user.  The package provides also a plotting function creating a graphical output
of the procedure: the p-value heat-map, the plot of the corrected p-values, and
the plot of the functional data.")

     "This package provides a versatile package that provides implementation of
various methods of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and Empirical Dynamics.  The
core of this package is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a key
technique for functional data analysis, for sparsely or densely sampled random
trajectories and time courses, via the Principal Analysis by Conditional
Estimation (PACE) algorithm.  This core algorithm yields covariance and mean
functions, eigenfunctions and principal component (scores), for both functional
data and derivatives, for both dense (functional) and sparse (longitudinal)
sampling designs.  For sparse designs, it provides fitted continuous
trajectories with confidence bands, even for subjects with very few longitudinal
observations.  PACE is a viable and flexible alternative to random effects
modeling of longitudinal data.  There is also a Matlab version (PACE) that
contains some methods not available on fdapace and vice versa.  Updates to
fdapace were supported by grants from NIH Echo and NSF DMS-1712864 and
DMS-2014626.  Please cite our package if you use it (You may run the command

the covariates are modelled as a multivariate Gaussian mixture model, where the
number of mixtures corresponds to the number of clusters.  The parameters of the
model are estimated by maximizing the observed mixture likelihood via an EM
algorithm (Arnqvist and SjÃ¶stedt de Luna, 2019)

densities, followed by ordinary Functional Principal Components Analysis (FPCA).
 Transformation modes of variation yield improved interpretation of the
variability in the data as compared to FPCA on the densities themselves.  The
standard fraction of variance explained (FVE) criterion commonly used for
functional data is adapted to the transformation setting, also allowing for an
alternative quantification of variability for density data through the
Wasserstein metric of optimal transport.")

     "This package provides an implementation of concurrent or varying coefficient
regression methods for functional data.  The implementations are done for both
dense and sparsely observed functional data.  Pointwise confidence bands can be
constructed for each case.  Further, the influence of past predictor values are
modeled by a smooth history index function, while the effects on the response
are described by smooth varying coefficient functions, which are very useful in
analyzing real data such as COVID data.  References: Yao, F., MÃ¼ller, H.G.,

Covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling based on the paper by Niemand &
Mai (2018) <doi:10.1007/s11747-018-0602-9>.  Flexible cutoffs are an alternative
to fixed cutoffs - rules-of-thumb - regarding an appropriate cutoff for fit
indices such as CFI or SRMR'.  It has been demonstrated that these flexible
cutoffs perform better than fixed cutoffs in grey areas where misspecification
is not easy to detect.  The package provides an alternative to the tool at
<https://flexiblecutoffs.org> as it allows to tailor flexible cutoffs to a given
dataset and model, which is so far not available in the tool.  The package
simulates fit indices based on a given dataset and model and then estimates the
flexible cutoffs.  Some useful functions, e.g., to determine the @code{GoF}- or
@code{BoF-nature} of a fit index, are provided.  So far, additional options for
a relative use (is a model better than another?) are provided in an exploratory

additionally the clamped types of the referred inference rules) and 4 threshold
functions in order to obtain the inference of the FCM (Fuzzy Cognitive Map).
Moreover, the fcm package returns a data frame of the concepts values of each
state after the inference procedure.  Fuzzy cognitive maps were introduced by
Kosko (1986) <doi:10.1002/int.4550010405> providing ideal causal cognition tools

 In addition, there are wrappers to parse a model, select a solver, find the
metabolic fluxes, and return the results applied to the original model.
Compared to other packages in this field, this package puts a much heavier focus
on providing reusable components that can be used in the design of new
implementation of new techniques, in particular those that involve large
parameter sweeps.  For a background on the theory, see What is Flux Balance

exogenous features and/or complex seasonality.  Originally described in Peterson
and Cavanaugh (2022) <doi:10.1007/s10182-021-00431-7> in the context of variable
selection with interactions and/or polynomials, ranked sparsity is a philosophy
with methods useful for variable selection in the presence of prior
informational asymmetry.  This situation exists for time series data with
complex seasonality, as shown in Peterson and Cavanaugh (2024)
<doi:10.1177/1471082X231225307>, which also describes this package in greater
detail.  The sparsity-ranked penalization methods for time series implemented in
@code{fastTS} can fit large/complex/high-frequency time series quickly, even
with a high-dimensional exogenous feature set.  The method is considerably
faster than its competitors, while often producing more accurate predictions.
Also included is a long hourly series of arrivals into the University of Iowa

    (description
     "Samples generalized random product graphs, a generalization of a broad class of
network models.  Given matrices X, S, and Y with with non-negative entries,
samples a matrix with expectation X S Y^T and independent Poisson or Bernoulli
entries using the @code{fastRG} algorithm of Rohe et al. (2017)
<https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v19/17-128.html>.  The algorithm first samples the
number of edges and then puts them down one-by-one.  As a result it is O(m)
where m is the number of edges, a dramatic improvement over element-wise
algorithms that which require O(n^2) operations to sample a random graph, where
n is the number of nodes.")

     "This package provides hardware-accelerated tools for performing rerandomization
and randomization testing in experimental research.  Using a JAX backend, the
package enables exact rerandomization inference even for large experiments with
hundreds of billions of possible randomizations.  Key functionalities include
generating pools of acceptable rerandomizations based on covariate balance,
conducting exact randomization tests, and performing pre-analysis evaluations to
determine optimal rerandomization acceptance thresholds.  The package supports
various hardware acceleration frameworks including CPU', CUDA', and METAL',
making it versatile across accelerated computing environments.  This allows
researchers to efficiently implement stringent rerandomization designs and
conduct valid inference even with large sample sizes.  The package is partly
based on Jerzak and Goldstein (2023) <doi:10.48550/@code{arXiv.2310.00861>}.")

package is currently the only package that supports a Bernoulli distribution, a
Multinomial distribution, and a Gaussian distribution, making it suitable for
both binary features, frequency counts, and numerical features.  Another feature
is the support of a mix of different event models.  Only numerical variables are
allowed, however, categorical variables can be transformed into dummies and used
with the Bernoulli distribution.  The implementation is largely based on the
paper \"A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes anti-spam e-mail filtering\"
written by K.M. Schneider (2003) <doi:10.3115/1067807.1067848>.  Any issues can

On systems without @code{OpenMP} support, the package automatically falls back
to single-threaded execution with no user configuration required.  For efficient
model selection, it integrates with CVST to provide sequential-testing
cross-validation that identifies competitive hyperparameters without exhaustive
grid search.  The package offers a unified interface for exact kernel ridge
regression and three scalable approximationsâNystrÃ¶m, Pivoted Cholesky, and
Random Fourier Featuresâallowing analyses with substantially larger sample
sizes than are feasible with exact KRR. It also integrates with the tidymodels
ecosystem via the parsnip model specification krr_reg', and the S3 method
@code{tunable.krr_reg()}.  To understand the theoretical background, one can
refer to Wainwright (2019) <doi:10.1017/9781108627771>.")

time-to-event data is modelled using a (cause-specific) Cox proportional hazards
regression model with time-fixed covariates.  The longitudinal biomarkers are
modelled using a linear mixed effects model.  The association between the
longitudinal submodel and the survival submodel is captured through shared
random effects.  It allows researchers to analyze large-scale data to model
biomarker trajectories, estimate their effects on event outcomes, and
dynamically predict future events from patientsâ past histories.  A function

the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm with four approximation methods for the

estimate the standard deviation of the estimated probabilities.  In addition, it
has functions that aggregate rows optimally to have more reliable estimates in
cases of having few data points.  For comparing the probability estimates of two
groups, a Wald test routine is implemented.  The library has data from the first
round of the Chilean Presidential Election 2021 and can also generate synthetic

(unrelated individuals), and SKAT-RC, which focuses on both rare and common
variants in population-based data.  When one applies @code{famSKAT-RC} and sets
the value of phi to 1, @code{famSKAT-RC} becomes @code{famSKAT}.  When one
applies @code{famSKAT-RC} and set the value of phi to 1 and the kinship matrix
to the identity matrix, @code{famSKAT-RC} becomes SKAT. When one applies
@code{famSKAT-RC} and set the kinship matrix (fullkins) to the identity matrix

data obtained from population-based, clinic-based, or multi-stage designs.
Appropriate ascertainment correction is utilized to estimate age-dependent
penetrance functions either parametrically from the fitted model or
nonparametrically from the data.  The Expectation and Maximization algorithm can
infer missing genotypes and carrier probabilities estimated from family's
genotype and phenotype information or from a fitted model.  Plot functions
include pedigrees of simulated families and predicted penetrance curves based on
specified parameter values.  For more information see Choi, Y.-H., Briollais,

Unfair algorithms can propagate such biases and produce predictions with a
disparate impact on various sensitive groups of individuals (defined by sex,
gender, ethnicity, religion, income, socioeconomic status, physical or mental
disabilities).  Fair algorithms possess the underlying foundation that these
groups should be treated similarly or have similar prediction outcomes.  The
fairness R package offers the calculation and comparisons of commonly and less
commonly used fairness metrics in population subgroups.  These methods are

     "We present FACT (Feature Attributions for @code{ClusTering}), a framework for
unsupervised interpretation methods that can be used with an arbitrary
clustering algorithm.  The package is capable of re-assigning instances to
clusters (algorithm agnostic), preserves the integrity of the data and does not
introduce additional models.  FACT is inspired by the principles of
model-agnostic interpretation in supervised learning.  Therefore, some of the
methods presented are based on iml', a R Package for Interpretable Machine
Learning by Christoph Molnar, Giuseppe Casalicchio, and Bernd Bischl (2018)

     "Overfitting Bayesian Mixtures of Factor Analyzers with Parsimonious Covariance and Unknown Number of Components")
    (description
     "Model-based clustering of multivariate continuous data using Bayesian mixtures
of factor analyzers (Papastamoulis (2019) <DOI:10.1007/s11222-019-09891-z>
(2018) <DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2018.03.007>).  The number of clusters is estimated
using overfitting mixture models (Rousseau and Mengersen (2011)
<DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00781.x>): suitable prior assumptions ensure that
asymptotically the extra components will have zero posterior weight, therefore,
the inference is based on the ``alive components.  A Gibbs sampler is
implemented in order to (approximately) sample from the posterior distribution
of the overfitting mixture.  A prior parallel tempering scheme is also
available, which allows to run multiple parallel chains with different prior
distributions on the mixture weights.  These chains run in parallel and can swap
states using a Metropolis-Hastings move.  Eight different parameterizations give
rise to parsimonious representations of the covariance per cluster (following Mc
Nicholas and Murphy (2008) <DOI:10.1007/s11222-008-9056-0>).  The model
parameterization and number of factors is selected according to the Bayesian
Information Criterion.  Identifiability issues related to label switching are
dealt by post-processing the simulated output with the Equivalence Classes
Representatives algorithm (Papastamoulis and Iliopoulos (2010)

initialization and optimization stages of existing forecasting methods.
Forecasting performance of the Ata method is superior to existing methods both
in terms of easy implementation and accurate forecasting.  It can be applied to
non-seasonal or seasonal time series which can be decomposed into four

for the estimation of the number and the location of multiple change points in
the network (or clustering) structure of multivariate high-dimensional time
series.  The method is motivated by the detection of change points in functional
connectivity networks for functional magnetic resonance imaging (@code{fMRI})
data. @code{FaBiSearch} uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an
unsupervised dimension reduction technique, and a new binary search algorithm to
identify multiple change points.  It requires minimal assumptions.  Lastly, we
provide interactive, 3-dimensional, brain-specific network visualization
capability in a flexible, stand-alone function.  This function can be
conveniently used with any node coordinate atlas, and nodes can be color coded
according to community membership, if applicable.  The output is an elegantly
displayed network laid over a cortical surface, which can be rotated in the
3-dimensional space.  The main routines of the package are @code{detect.cps()},
for multiple change point detection, @code{est.net()}, for estimating a network
between stationary multivariate time series, @code{net.3dplot()}, for plotting
the estimated functional connectivity networks, and @code{opt.rank()}, for
finding the optimal rank in NMF for a given data set.  The functions have been
extensively tested on simulated multivariate high-dimensional time series data
and @code{fMRI} data.  For details on the @code{FaBiSearch} methodology, please
see Ondrus et al. (2021) <@code{arXiv:2103.06347>}.  For a more detailed
explanation and applied examples of the fabisearch package, please see Ondrus
