Within this framework, Distribution Entropy (DE) is utilized to measure the
uncertainty of feature categories of @code{AgNPs}, Proclivity Entropy (PE)
assesses the preference of these categories, and Combination Entropy (CE)
quantifies the uncertainty of feature combinations of @code{AgNPs}.
Additionally, a Markov chain model is employed to examine the relationships
among the sub-features of @code{AgNPs} and to determine a Transition Score (TS)
scoring standard that is based on steady-state probabilities.  The
@code{sysAgNPs} framework provides metrics for evaluating @code{AgNPs}, which
helps to unravel their complexity and facilitates effective comparisons among
different @code{AgNPs}, thereby advancing the scientific research and
application of these @code{AgNPs}.")

    (description
     "This package provides a tool for producing synthetic versions of microdata
containing confidential information so that they are safe to be released to
users for exploratory analysis.  The key objective of generating synthetic data
is to replace sensitive original values with synthetic ones causing minimal
distortion of the statistical information contained in the data set.  Variables,
which can be categorical or continuous, are synthesised one-by-one using
sequential modelling.  Replacements are generated by drawing from conditional
distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or classification and
regression trees models.  Data are synthesised via the function @code{syn()}
which can be largely automated, if default settings are used, or with methods
defined by the user.  Optional parameters can be used to influence the
disclosure risk and the analytical quality of the synthesised data.  For a
description of the implemented method see Nowok, Raab and Dibben (2016)
<doi:10.18637/jss.v074.i11>.  Functions to assess identity and attribute
disclosure for the original and for the synthetic data are included in the
package, and their use is illustrated in a vignette on disclosure (Practical
Privacy Metrics for Synthetic Data).")

     "Creation of an individual claims simulator which generates various features of
non-life insurance claims.  An initial set of test parameters, designed to
mirror the experience of an Auto Liability portfolio, were set up and applied by
default to generate a realistic test data set of individual claims (see
vignette).  The simulated data set then allows practitioners to back-test the
validity of various reserving models and to prove and/or disprove certain
actuarial assumptions made in claims modelling.  The distributional assumptions
used to generate this data set can be easily modified by users to match their
experiences.  Reference: Avanzi B, Taylor G, Wang M, Wong B (2020)

    (description
     "An index is created using a mathematical model that transforms multi-dimensional
variables into a single value.  These variables are often correlated, and while
PCA-based indices can address the issue of multicollinearity, they typically do
not account for survey weights, which can lead to inaccurate rankings of survey
units such as households, districts, or states.  To resolve this, the current
package facilitates the development of a principal component analysis-based
composite index by incorporating survey weights for each sample observation.
This ensures the generation of a survey-weighted principal component-based
normalized composite index.  Additionally, the package provides a normalized
principal component-based composite index and ranks the sample observations
based on the values of the composite indices.  For method details see, Skinner,

development basis) .hy3 files.  Once read in, @code{SwimmeR} can convert
swimming times (performances) between the computationally useful format of
seconds reported to the 100ths place (e.g. 95.37), and the conventional
reporting format (1:35.37) used in the swimming community. @code{SwimmeR} can
also score meets in a variety of formats with user defined point values, convert
times between courses ('LCM', SCM', SCY') and draw single elimination brackets,
as well as providing a suite of tools for working cleaning swimming data.  This
is a developmental package, not yet mature.")

the need to use standard palettes developed within an organization to ensure

way to read these swatch files in R and avoid transcribing or converting color

read and inspect Adobe Color ('ACO'), Adobe Swatch Exchange ('ASE'), GIMP

    (description
     "Obtaining accurate and stable estimates of regression coefficients can be
challenging when the suggested statistical model has issues related to
multicollinearity, convergence, or overfitting.  One solution is to use
principal component analysis (PCA) results in the regression, as discussed in
Chan and Park (2005) <doi:10.1080/01446190500039812>.  The @code{swaprinc()}
package streamlines comparisons between a raw regression model with the full set
of raw independent variables and a principal component regression model where
principal components are estimated on a subset of the independent variables,
then swapped into the regression model in place of those variables.  The
@code{swaprinc()} function compares one raw regression model to one principal
component regression model, while the @code{compswap()} function compares one
raw regression model to many principal component regression models.  Package
functions include parameters to center, scale, and undo centering and scaling,
as described by Harvey and Hansen (2022)
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=@code{LearnPCA/vignettes/Vig_03_Step_By_Step_PCA.pdf>}.
 Additionally, the package supports using Gifi methods to extract principal
components from categorical variables, as outlined by Rossiter (2021)

picks those with the best performance in terms of training error.  Throughout,
the algorithm uses the information coming from the best learners at the previous

    (description
     "In practice, it is difficult to determine the number of decomposition modes, K,
for Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD).  To overcome this issue, this study
offers Spearman Variational Mode Decomposition (SVMD), a method that uses the
Spearman correlation coefficient to calculate the ideal mode number.  Unlike the
Pearson correlation coefficient, which only returns a perfect value when X and Y
are linearly connected, the Spearman correlation can be calculated without
knowing the probability distributions of X and Y. The Spearman correlation
coefficient, also called Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, is a subset of
a wider correlation coefficient.  As VMD decomposes a signal, the Spearman
correlation coefficient between the reconstructed and original sequences rises
as the mode number K increases.  Once the signal has been fully decomposed,
subsequent increases in K cause the correlation to gradually level off.  When
the correlation reaches a specific level, VMD is said to have adequately
decomposed the signal.  Numerous experiments revealed that a threshold of 0.997
produces the best denoising effect, so the threshold is set at 0.997.  This
package has been developed using concept of Yang et al.

     "This package implements methods for variable selection in linear regression
based on the \"Sum of Single Effects\" (@code{SuSiE}) model, as described in Wang
et al (2020) <DOI:10.1101/501114> and Zou et al (2021)
<DOI:10.1101/2021.11.03.467167>.  These methods provide simple summaries, called
\"Credible Sets\", for accurately quantifying uncertainty in which variables
should be selected.  The methods are motivated by genetic fine-mapping
applications, and are particularly well-suited to settings where variables are
highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse.  The fitting algorithm, a
Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods called \"Iterative Bayesian
Stepwise Selection\" (IBSS), is simple and fast, allowing the @code{SuSiE} model
be fit to large data sets (thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of
variables).")

     "Package performs Cox regression and survival distribution function estimation
when the survival times are subject to double truncation.  In case that the
survival and truncation times are quasi-independent, the estimation procedure
for each method involves inverse probability weighting, where the weights
correspond to the inverse of the selection probabilities and are estimated using
the survival times and truncation times only.  A test for checking this
independence assumption is also included in this package.  The functions
available in this package for Cox regression, survival distribution function
estimation, and testing independence under double truncation are based on the
following methods, respectively: Rennert and Xie (2018)
<doi:10.1111/biom.12809>, Shen (2010) <doi:10.1007/s10463-008-0192-2>, Martin
and Betensky (2005) <doi:10.1198/016214504000001538>.  When the survival times
are dependent on at least one of the truncation times, an EM algorithm is
employed to obtain point estimates for the regression coefficients.  The
standard errors are calculated using the bootstrap method.  See Rennert and Xie
(2022) <doi:10.1111/biom.13451>.  Both the independent and dependent cases
assume no censoring is present in the data.  Please contact Lior Rennert

shown that there is non-negligible inflation of the type I error rate in the
commonly used asymptotic test for the RMST comparison.  Generally, permutation
tests can be useful in such a situation.  However, when we apply the permutation
test for the RMST comparison, particularly in small sample situations, there are
some cases where the survival function in either group cannot be defined due to
censoring in the permutation process.  Horiguchi and Uno (2020)
<doi:10.1002/sim.8565> have examined six workable solutions to handle this

     "Multidimensional Penalized Splines for (Excess) Hazard Models, Relative Mortality Ratio Models and Marginal Intensity Models")
    (description
     "Fits (excess) hazard, relative mortality ratio or marginal intensity models with
multidimensional penalized splines allowing for time-dependent effects,
non-linear effects and interactions between several continuous covariates.  In
survival and net survival analysis, in addition to modelling the effect of time
(via the baseline hazard), one has often to deal with several continuous
covariates and model their functional forms, their time-dependent effects, and
their interactions.  Model specification becomes therefore a complex problem and
penalized regression splines represent an appealing solution to that problem as
splines offer the required flexibility while penalization limits overfitting
issues.  Current implementations of penalized survival models can be slow or
unstable and sometimes lack some key features like taking into account expected
mortality to provide net survival and excess hazard estimates.  In contrast,
@code{survPen} provides an automated, fast, and stable implementation (thanks to
explicit calculation of the derivatives of the likelihood) and offers a unified
framework for multidimensional penalized hazard and excess hazard models.  Later
versions (>2.0.0) include penalized models for relative mortality ratio, and
marginal intensity in recurrent event setting. @code{survPen} may be of interest
to those who 1) analyse any kind of time-to-event data: mortality, disease
relapse, machinery breakdown, unemployment, etc 2) wish to describe the
associated hazard and to understand which predictors impact its dynamics, 3)
wish to model the relative mortality ratio between a cohort and a reference
population, 4) wish to describe the marginal intensity for recurrent event data.

    (description
     "This package contains a suite of functions for survival analysis in health
economics.  These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist (based
on maximum likelihood) or a Bayesian approach (both based on Integrated Nested
Laplace Approximation or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo).  To run the Bayesian models,
the user needs to install additional modules (packages), i.e. @code{survHEinla}
and @code{survHEhmc}'.  These can be installed from
<https://giabaio.r-universe.dev/> using install.packages(\"@code{survHEhmc}\",
repos = c(\"https://giabaio.r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")) and
install.packages(\"@code{survHEinla}\", repos =
c(\"https://giabaio.r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))
respectively. @code{survHEinla} is based on the package INLA, which is available
for download at <https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable/>.  The user can
specify a set of parametric models using a common notation and select the
preferred mode of inference.  The results can also be post-processed to produce
probabilistic sensitivity analysis and can be used to export the output to an
Excel file (e.g. for a Markov model, as often done by modellers and
practitioners). <doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i14>.")

their potential to improve plans for conserving biodiversity (e.g. plans for
establishing protected areas).  Given a set of sites that could potentially be
acquired for conservation management, it can be used to generate and evaluate
plans for surveying additional sites.  Specifically, plans for ecological
surveys can be generated using various conventional approaches (e.g. maximizing
expected species richness, geographic coverage, diversity of sampled
environmental algorithms.  After generating such survey plans, they can be
evaluated using conditions) and maximizing value of information.  Please note
that several functions depend on the Gurobi optimization software (available
from <https://www.gurobi.com>).  Additionally, the JAGS software (available from
<https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/>) is required to fit hierarchical generalized
linear models.  For further details, see Hanson et al. (2023)

parameters by observing a representative part of the population, called sample.
The SRSWOR (Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement) is one of the most
widely used probability sampling designs, wherein every unit has an equal chance
of being selected and units are not repeated.This function draws multiple SRSWOR
samples from a finite population and estimates the population parameter i.e.
total of HT, Ratio, and Regression estimators.  Repeated simulations (e.g., 500
times) are used to assess and compare estimators using metrics such as percent
relative bias (%RB), percent relative root means square error (%RRMSE).For
details on sampling methodology, see, Cochran (1977) \"Sampling Techniques\"

point processes of epidemic phenomena.  The monitoring methods focus on
aberration detection in count data time series from public health surveillance
of communicable diseases, but applications could just as well originate from
environmetrics, reliability engineering, econometrics, or social sciences.  The
package implements many typical outbreak detection procedures such as the
(improved) Farrington algorithm, or the negative binomial GLR-CUSUM method of
Hoehle and Paul (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.015>.  A novel CUSUM approach
combining logistic and multinomial logistic modeling is also included.  The
package contains several real-world data sets, the ability to simulate outbreak
data, and to visualize the results of the monitoring in a temporal, spatial or
spatio-temporal fashion.  A recent overview of the available monitoring
procedures is given by Salmon et al. (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10>.  For
the retrospective analysis of epidemic spread, the package provides three
endemic-epidemic modeling frameworks with tools for visualization, likelihood
inference, and simulation. @code{hhh4()} estimates models for (multivariate)
count time series following Paul and Held (2011) <doi:10.1002/sim.4177> and
Meyer and Held (2014) <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>. @code{twinSIR()} models the
susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) event history of a fixed population, e.g,
epidemics across farms or networks, as a multivariate point process as proposed
by Hoehle (2009) <doi:10.1002/bimj.200900050>. @code{twinstim()} estimates
self-exciting point process models for a spatio-temporal point pattern of
infective events, e.g., time-stamped geo-referenced surveillance data, as
proposed by Meyer et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01684.x>.  A

internally validated concordance index, time-dependent area under the curve,
Brier score, calibration slope, and statistical testing of non-linear ensemble

the gain of using a more complex survival model, or justify its redundancy.
Equally, it shows the performance value of the non-linear and interaction terms,
and may highlight the need of further feature transformation.  Further details

the target outcome, this package jointly models the target and surrogate
outcomes within a bivariate regression framework.  Unobserved values of either
outcome are treated as missing data.  In contrast to imputation-based inference,
no assumptions are required regarding the relationship between the target and
surrogate outcomes.  Estimation in the presence of bilateral outcome missingness
is performed via an expectation conditional maximization either algorithm.  In
the case of unilateral target missingness, estimation is performed using an
accelerated least squares procedure.  A flexible association test is provided
for evaluating hypotheses about the target regression parameters.  For

     "This package provides functions to estimate the proportion of treatment effect
on a censored primary outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on a
censored surrogate outcome/event.  All methods are described in detail in
Parast, Tian, Cai (2020) \"Assessing the Value of a Censored Surrogate Outcome\"
<doi:10.1007/s10985-019-09473-1>.  The main functions are (1) @code{R.q.event()}
which calculates the proportion of the treatment effect (the difference in
restricted mean survival time at time t) explained by surrogate outcome
information observed up to a selected landmark time, (2) @code{R.t.estimate()}
which calculates the proportion of the treatment effect explained by primary
outcome information only observed up to a selected landmark time, and (3)
@code{IV.event()} which calculates the incremental value of the surrogate
outcome information.")

    (description
     "In a clinical trial, it frequently occurs that the most credible outcome to
evaluate the effectiveness of a new therapy (the true endpoint) is difficult to
measure.  In such a situation, it can be an effective strategy to replace the
true endpoint by a (bio)marker that is easier to measure and that allows for a
prediction of the treatment effect on the true endpoint (a surrogate endpoint).
The package Surrogate allows for an evaluation of the appropriateness of a
candidate surrogate endpoint based on the meta-analytic, information-theoretic,
and causal-inference frameworks.  Part of this software has been developed using
funding provided from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for
research, technological development and demonstration (Grant Agreement no

40 897-919 <doi:10.1002/sim.8809>.  Xo is the matrix of predictor variables.  y
is the response variable.  Currently only binary responses using logistic
regression are supported.  X is a matrix of additional predictors which should
be scaled to have sum 1 prior to analysis.  fold is the number of folds for
cross-validation.  Alpha is the parameter for the elastic net method used in the
subsampling procedure: the default value of 1 corresponds to LASSO. prop is the
proportion of variables to remove in the each subsample.  weights indicates
whether observations should be weighted by class size.  When the class sizes are
unbalanced, weighting observations can improve results.  B is the number of
subsamples to use for ranking the variables.  C is the number of permutations to
use for estimating the critical value of the null distribution.  If the
@code{doParallel} package is installed, the function can be run in parallel by
setting ncores to the number of threads to use.  If the default value of 1 is
used, or if the @code{doParallel} package is not installed, the function does
not run in parallel.  display.progress indicates whether the function should
display messages indicating its progress.  family is a family variable for the
@code{glm()} fitting.  Note that the glmnet package does not permit the use of
nonstandard link functions, so will always use the default link function.
However, the @code{glm()} fitting will use the specified link.  The default is
binomial with logistic regression, because this is a common use case.  pval is
the p-value for inclusion of a variable in the model.  Under the null case, the
number of false positives will be geometrically distributed with this as
probability of success, so if this parameter is set to p, the expected number of
false positives should be p/(1-p).")

multi-profile case (Case 3) best-worst scaling (BWS).  Case 3 BWS is a
question-based survey method to elicit people's preferences for attribute
levels.  Case 3 BWS constructs various combinations of attribute levels
(profiles) and then asks respondents to select the best and worst profiles in
each choice set.  A main function creates a dataset for the analysis from the
choice sets and the responses to the questions.  For details on Case 3 BWS,

result of a subgroup screening is a diagram in which each single dot stands for
a subgroup.  The diagram may show thousands of them.  The position of the dot in
the diagram is determined by the sample size of the subgroup and the statistical
measure of the treatment effect in that subgroup.  The sample size is shown on
the horizontal axis while the treatment effect is displayed on the vertical
axis.  Furthermore, the diagram shows the line of no effect and the overall
study results.  For small subgroups, which are found on the left side of the
plot, larger random deviations from the mean study effect are expected, while
for larger subgroups only small deviations from the study mean can be expected
to be chance findings.  So for a study with no conspicuous subgroup effects, the
dots in the figure are expected to form a kind of funnel.  Any deviations from
this funnel shape hint to conspicuous subgroups.")

     "The Structural Topic and Sentiment-Discourse (STS) model allows researchers to
estimate topic models with document-level metadata that determines both topic
prevalence and sentiment-discourse.  The sentiment-discourse is modeled as a
document-level latent variable for each topic that modulates the word frequency
within a topic.  These latent topic sentiment-discourse variables are controlled
by the document-level metadata.  The STS model can be useful for regression
analysis with text data in addition to topic modelingâs traditional use of
descriptive analysis.  The method was developed in Chen and Mankad (2024)

treat structured missingness by design [Cai T, Cai TT, Zhang A (2016)

efficient matrix recovery when a subset of the rows and columns of an
approximately low-rank matrix are observed.  The main function in our package,
@code{smc.FUN()}, is for recovery of the missing block A22 of an approximately
low-rank matrix A given the other blocks A11, A12, A21.")

     "Random Forest-like tree ensemble that works with groups of predictor variables.
When building a tree, a number of variables is taken randomly from each group
separately, thus ensuring that it considers variables from each group for the
splits.  Useful when rows contain information about different things (e.g. user
information and product information) and it's not sensible to make a prediction
with information from only one group of variables, or when there are far more
variables from one group than the other and it's desired to have groups appear
evenly on trees.  Trees are grown using the C5.0 algorithm rather than the usual
CART algorithm.  Supports parallelization (multithreaded), missing values in
predictors, and categorical variables (without doing One-Hot encoding in the
processing).  Can also be used to create a regular (non-stratified) Random
Forest-like model, but made up of C5.0 trees and with some additional control
options.  As it's built with C5.0 trees, it works only for classification (not
for regression).")

restrictions imposed on sample sizes in strata.  There are few different
algorithms available to use, and one them is based on popular sample allocation
method that applies Neyman allocation to recursively reduced set of strata.
This package also provides the function that computes a solution to the minimum
cost allocation problem, which is a minor modification of the classical optimum
sample allocation.  This problem lies in the determination of a vector of strata
sample sizes that minimizes total cost of the survey, under assumed fixed level
of the stratified estimator's variance.  As in the case of the classical optimum
allocation, the problem of minimum cost allocation can be complemented by
imposing upper-bounds constraints on sample sizes in strata.")

flexible hypothesis testing method that can simultaneously test for constant,
early, middle, and late treatment effects.  However, the majority of the
Max-Combo test performed in clinical studies are unstratified, ignoring the
important prognostic stratification factors.  To fill this gap, we have
developed an R package for stratified Max-Combo testing that accounts for
stratified baseline factors.  Our package explores various methods for
calculating combined test statistics, estimating joint distributions, and
determining the p-values.")

    (description
     "This package provides tools for transport planning with an emphasis on spatial
transport data and non-motorized modes.  The package was originally developed to
support the Propensity to Cycle Tool', a publicly available strategic cycle
network planning tool (Lovelace et al.  2017) <doi:10.5198/jtlu.2016.862>, but
has since been extended to support public transport routing and accessibility
analysis (Moreno-Monroy et al.  2017) <doi:10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.08.012> and
routing with locally hosted routing engines such as OSRM (Lowans et al.  2023)
<doi:10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117337>.  The main functions are for creating and
manipulating geographic \"desire lines\" from origin-destination (OD) data
(building on the od package); calculating routes on the transport network
locally and via interfaces to routing services such as
<https://cyclestreets.net/> (Desjardins et al.  2021)
<doi:10.1007/s11116-021-10197-1>; and calculating route segment attributes such
as bearing.  The package implements the travel flow aggregration method
described in Morgan and Lovelace (2020) <doi:10.1177/2399808320942779> and the
OD jittering method described in Lovelace et al. (2022)
<doi:10.32866/001c.33873>.  Further information on the package's aim and scope
can be found in the vignettes and in a paper in the R Journal (Lovelace and
Ellison 2018) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053>, and in a paper outlining the landscape
of open source software for geographic methods in transport planning (Lovelace,
2021) <doi:10.1007/s10109-020-00342-2>.")

    (synopsis "Structure Optimized Proximity Scaling")
    (description
     "This package provides methods that use flexible variants of multidimensional
scaling (MDS) which incorporate parametric nonlinear distance transformations
and trade-off the goodness-of-fit fit with structure considerations to find
optimal hyperparameters, also known as structure optimized proximity scaling
(STOPS) (Rusch, Mair & Hornik, 2023,<doi:10.1007/s11222-022-10197-w>).  The
package contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting,
plotting and displaying different 1-way MDS models with ratio, interval, ordinal
optimal scaling in a STOPS framework.  These cover essentially the functionality
of the package smacofx, including Torgerson (classical) scaling with power
transformations of dissimilarities, SMACOF MDS with powers of dissimilarities,
Sammon mapping with powers of dissimilarities, elastic scaling with powers of
dissimilarities, spherical SMACOF with powers of dissimilarities, (ALSCAL)
s-stress MDS with powers of dissimilarities, r-stress MDS, MDS with powers of
dissimilarities and configuration distances, elastic scaling powers of
dissimilarities and configuration distances, Sammon mapping powers of
dissimilarities and configuration distances, power stress MDS (POST-MDS),
approximate power stress, Box-Cox MDS, local MDS, Isomap, curvilinear component
analysis (CLCA), curvilinear distance analysis (CLDA) and sparsified (power)
multidimensional scaling and (power) multidimensional distance analysis
(experimental models from smacofx influenced by CLCA).  All of these models can
also be fit by optimizing over hyperparameters based on goodness-of-fit fit only
(i.e., no structure considerations).  The package further contains functions for
optimization, specifically the adaptive Luus-Jaakola algorithm and a wrapper for
Bayesian optimization with treed Gaussian process with jumps to linear models,
and functions for various c-structuredness indices.  Hyperparameter optimization
can be done with a number of techniques but we recommend either Bayesian
optimization or particle swarm.  For using \"Kriging\", users need to install a
version of the archived @code{DiceOptim} R package.")

 This was further expanded on by Masden (2015) <doi:10.7489/1659-1> and code
used here is heavily derived from this work with input from Dr A. Cook at the
British Trust for Ornithology.  These collision risk models are useful for
marine ornithologists who are working in the offshore wind industry,
particularly in UK waters.  However, many of the species included in the
stochastic collision risk models can also be found in the North Atlantic in the
United States and Canada, and could be applied there.")

spatially-and-temporally varying coefficient models using Generalized Additive
Models with smooths.  The smooths are parameterised with location, time and
predictor variables.  The framework supports the investigation of the presence
and nature of any space-time dependencies in the data by evaluating multiple
model forms (specifications) using a Generalized Cross-Validation score.  The
workflow sequence is to: i) Prepare the data by lengthening it to have a single
location and time variables for each observation.  ii) Evaluate all possible
spatial and/or temporal models in which each predictor is specified in different
ways.  iii) Evaluate each model and pick the best one.  iv) Create the final
model.  v) Calculate the varying coefficient estimates to quantify how the
relationships between the target and predictor variables vary over space, time
or space-time.  vi) Create maps, time series plots etc.  For more details see:

metrics in a single function call, visualize variable selection processes, and
export results in various formats.  However, @code{StepReg} should not be used
for statistical inference unless the variable selection process is explicitly
accounted for, as it can compromise the validity of the results.  This
limitation does not apply when @code{StepReg} is used for prediction purposes.
We validated @code{StepReg's} accuracy using public datasets within the SAS
software environment.  Additionally, @code{StepReg} features an interactive

of stepwise regression methods with the predictive power of the Geographically
Weighted Regression(GWR) model.The developed hybrid model follows a two-step
approach where the stepwise variable selection method is applied first to
identify the subset of predictors that have the most significant impact on the
response variable, and then a GWR model is fitted using those selected variables
for spatial prediction at test or unknown locations.  For method details,see
Leung, Y., Mei, C. L. and Zhang, W. X. (2000).<DOI:10.1068/a3162>.This hybrid
spatial model aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of GWR
predictions by selecting a subset of relevant variables through a stepwise
selection process.This approach is particularly useful for modeling spatially
varying relationships and improving the accuracy of spatial predictions.")

    (description
     "This package provides tools to help download, process and analyse the UK road
collision data collected using the STATS19 form.  The datasets are provided as
CSV files with detailed road safety information about the circumstances of car
crashes and other incidents on the roads resulting in casualties in Great
Britain from 1979 to present.  Tables are available on colissions with the
circumstances (e.g. speed limit of road), information about vehicles involved
(e.g. type of vehicle), and casualties (e.g. age).  The statistics relate only
to events on public roads that were reported to the police, and subsequently
recorded, using the STATS19 collision reporting form.  See the Department for
Transport website
<https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-accidents-safety-data>

the Journal of Open Source Software (Lovelace et al.  2019)

     "This package provides a lightweight tool that provides a reproducible workflow
for selecting and executing appropriate statistical analysis in one-way or
two-way experimental designs.  The package automatically checks for data
normality, conducts parametric (ANOVA) or non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis) tests,
performs post-hoc comparisons with Compact Letter Displays (CLD), and generates
publication-ready boxplots, faceted plots, and heatmaps.  It is designed for
researchers seeking fast, automated statistical summaries and visualization.
Based on established statistical methods including Shapiro and Wilk (1965)

     "Allows the user to estimate a vector logistic smooth transition autoregressive
model via maximum log-likelihood or nonlinear least squares.  It further permits
to test for linearity in the multivariate framework against a vector logistic
smooth transition autoregressive model with a single transition variable.  The
estimation method is discussed in Terasvirta and Yang (2014,
<doi:10.1108/S0731-9053(2013)0000031008>).  Also, realized covariances can be
constructed from stock market prices or returns, as explained in Andersen et al.

samplers to sample from a posterior distribution.  This package determines
whether the MCMC sample is large enough to yield reliable estimates of the
target distribution.  In particular, this calculates a Gelman-Rubin convergence
diagnostic using stable and consistent estimators of Monte Carlo variance.
Additionally, this uses the connection between an MCMC sample's effective sample
size and the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic to produce a threshold for terminating MCMC
simulation.  Finally, this informs the user whether enough samples have been
collected and (if necessary) estimates the number of samples needed for a
desired level of accuracy.  The theory underlying these methods can be found in

enlarges the original labeled set using the most confident predictions to

classification problems in several domains by the specification of a supervised

    (description
     "Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an
identical sample size.  Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement),
which is a popular method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its
poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure.  In
the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the
use of rarefying.  An alternative to rarefying is scaling with ranked
subsampling (SRS).  SRS consists of two steps.  In the first step, the total
counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are
divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled
counts Cscaled equals Cmin.  In the second step, the non-integer Cscaled values
are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling.  The
Cscaled value for each OTU or species is split into the integer part Cint (Cint
= floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cints).
Since the sum of Cint is smaller or equal to Cmin, additional delta C = Cmin -
the sum of Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count
of Cmin.  This is achieved as follows.  OTUs are ranked in the descending order
of their Cfrac values.  Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count
per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added
counts reaches delta C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library
equals Cmin.  When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking delta C counts is shared
by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are
selected in the order of their Cint values.  This selection minimizes the effect
of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs.  OTUs with identical Cfrag
as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.  See Beule & Karlovsky
(2020) <doi:10.7717/peerj.9593> for details.")

     "Artificial selection through selective breeding is an efficient way to induce
changes in traits of interest in experimental populations.  This package (sra)
provides a set of tools to analyse artificial-selection response datasets.  The
data typically feature for several generations the average value of a trait in a
population, the variance of the trait, the population size and the average value
of the parents that were chosen to breed.  Sra implements two families of models
aiming at describing the dynamics of the genetic architecture of the trait
during the selection response.  The first family relies on purely descriptive
(phenomenological) models, based on an autoregressive framework.  The second
family provides different mechanistic models, accounting e.g. for inbreeding,
mutations, genetic and environmental canalization, or epistasis.  The parameters
underlying the dynamics of the time series are estimated by maximum likelihood.
The sra package thus provides (i) a wrapper for the R functions @code{mle()} and
@code{optim()} aiming at fitting in a convenient way a predetermined set of
models, and (ii) some functions to plot and analyze the output of the models.")

     "Finds causal connections in precision data, finds lags and embeddings in time
series, guides training of neural networks and other smooth models, evaluates
their performance, gives a mathematically grounded answer to the over-training
problem.  Smooth regression is based on the Gamma test, which measures
smoothness in a multivariate relationship.  Causal relations are smooth, noise
is not.  sr includes the Gamma test and search techniques that use it.

     "It is often useful to produce short, quasi-unique identifiers (SQUIDs) without
the benefit of a central authority to prevent duplication.  Although Universally
Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) provide for this, these are also unwieldy; for
example, the most used UUID, version 4, is 36 characters long.  SQUIDs are short
(8 characters) at the expense of having more collisions, which can be mitigated
by combining them with human-produced suffixes, yielding relatively brief, half
human-readable, almost-unique identifiers (see for example the identifiers used
for Decentralized Construct Taxonomies; Peters & Crutzen, 2024
<doi:10.15626/MP.2022.3638>).  SQUIDs are the number of centiseconds elapsed
since the beginning of 1970 converted to a base 30 system.  This package
contains functions to produce SQUIDs as well as convert them back into dates and

mixed-effects models.  Users can experience how the mixed-effects model
framework can be used to understand distinct biological phenomena by
interactively exploring simulated multilevel data.  Second, it offers research
opportunities to those who are already familiar with mixed-effects models, as it
enables the generation of data sets that users may download and use for a range
of simulation-based statistical analyses such as power and sensitivity analysis

     "Spatio-temporal data have become increasingly popular in many research fields.
Such data often have complex structures that are difficult to describe and

focus on spatial data.  Spatially balanced samples are selected using the
Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) algorithm.  The GRTS algorithm
can be applied to finite resources (point geometries) and infinite resources
(linear / linestring and areal / polygon geometries) and flexibly accommodates a
diverse set of sampling design features, including stratification, unequal
inclusion probabilities, proportional (to size) inclusion probabilities, legacy
(historical) sites, a minimum distance between sites, and two options for
replacement sites (reverse hierarchical order and nearest neighbor).  Data are
analyzed using a wide range of analysis functions that perform categorical
variable analysis, continuous variable analysis, attributable risk analysis,
risk difference analysis, relative risk analysis, change analysis, and trend
analysis.  spsurvey can also be used to summarize objects, visualize objects,
select samples that are not spatially balanced, select panel samples, measure
the amount of spatial balance in a sample, adjust design weights, and more.  For
additional details, see Dumelle et al. (2023) <doi:10.18637/jss.v105.i03>.")

     "Processing and analysis of field collected or simulated sprinkler system catch
data (depths) to characterize irrigation uniformity and efficiency using
standard and other measures.  Standard measures include the Christiansen
coefficient of uniformity (CU) as found in Christiansen, J.E.(1942,
ISBN:0138779295, \"Irrigation by Sprinkling\"); and distribution uniformity (DU),
potential efficiency of the low quarter (PELQ), and application efficiency of
the low quarter (AELQ) that are implementations of measures of the same notation
in Keller, J. and Merriam, J.L. (1978) \"Farm Irrigation System Evaluation: A
Guide for Management\" <https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG745.pdf>.
spreval::DU.lh is similar to spreval::DU but is the distribution uniformity of
the low half instead of low quarter as in DU. spreval::PELQT is a version of
spreval::PELQ adapted for traveling systems instead of lateral move or solid-set
sprinkler systems.  The function spreval::eff is analogous to the method used to
compute application efficiency for furrow irrigation presented in Walker, W. and
Skogerboe, G.V. (1987,ISBN:0138779295, \"Surface Irrigation: Theory and
Practice\"),that uses piecewise integration of infiltrated depth compared against
soil-moisture deficit (SMD), when the argument \"target\" is set equal to SMD. The
other functions contained in the package provide graphical representation of
sprinkler system uniformity, and other standard univariate parametric and
non-parametric statistical measures as applied to sprinkler system catch depths.
 A sample data set of field test data spreval::catchcan (catch depths) is
provided and is used in examples and vignettes.  Agricultural systems
emphasized, but this package can be used for landscape irrigation evaluation,
and a landscape (turf) vignette is included as an example application.")

used geostatistical methods, two machine learning methods, four hybrid methods
and two averaging methods.  For each method, two functions are provided.  One
function is for assessing the predictive errors and accuracy of the method based
on cross-validation.  The other one is for generating spatial predictions using
the method.  For details please see: Li, J., Potter, A., Huang, Z., Daniell, J.

as separate arguments.  When these are expensive to calculate it may be much
faster to calculate the function (fn) and gradient (gr) together since they
often share many calculations (chain rule).  This package allows the user to
pass in a single function that returns both the function and gradient, then
splits (hence splitfngr') them so the results can be accessed separately.  The
functions provided allow this to be done with any number of functions/values,
not just for functions and gradients.")

     "Splines are efficiently represented through their Taylor expansion at the knots.
 The representation accounts for the support sets and is thus suitable for
sparse functional data.  Two cases of boundary conditions are considered:
zero-boundary or periodic-boundary for all derivatives except the last.  The
periodical splines are represented graphically using polar coordinates.  The
B-splines and orthogonal bases of splines that reside on small total support are
implemented.  The orthogonal bases are referred to as splinets and are utilized
for functional data analysis.  Random spline generator is implemented as well as
all fundamental algebraic and calculus operations on splines.  The optimal, in
the least square sense, functional fit by splinets to data consisting of sampled
values of functions as well as splines build over another set of knots is
obtained and used for functional data analysis.  The S4-version of the object
oriented R is used. <doi:10.48550/@code{arXiv.2102.00733>},

    (description
     "Many complex diseases are known to be affected by the interactions between
genetic variants and environmental exposures beyond the main genetic and
environmental effects.  Existing Bayesian methods for gene-environment (GÃE)
interaction studies are challenged by the high-dimensional nature of the study
and the complexity of environmental influences.  We have developed a novel and
powerful semi-parametric Bayesian variable selection method that can accommodate
linear and nonlinear GÃE interactions simultaneously (Ren et al. (2020)
<doi:10.1002/sim.8434>).  Furthermore, the proposed method can conduct
structural identification by distinguishing nonlinear interactions from main
effects only case within Bayesian framework.  Spike-and-slab priors are
incorporated on both individual and group level to shrink coefficients
corresponding to irrelevant main and interaction effects to zero exactly.  The
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms of the proposed and alternative methods are
efficiently implemented in C++.")

function of the package is @code{unif_test()}, which conveniently collects more
than 35 tests for assessing uniformity on S^{p-1} = {x in R^p : ||x|| = 1}, p >=
2.  The test statistics are implemented in the @code{unif_stat()} function,
which allows computing several statistics for different samples within a single
call, thus facilitating Monte Carlo experiments.  Furthermore, the
@code{unif_stat_MC()} function allows parallelizing them in a simple way.  The
asymptotic null distributions of the statistics are available through the
function @code{unif_stat_distr()}.  The core of sphunif is coded in C++ by
relying on the Rcpp package.  The package also provides several novel datasets
and gives the replicability for the data applications/simulations in

estimated non-parametrically.  Functional parameters are approximated by
smoothing splines, whose coefficients are estimated by penalized maximum
likelihood using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.  E- and M-steps can
be parallelized on multi-thread computing platforms that support @code{OpenMP}'.
 Both continuous and unordered categorical response variables are supported.")

     "This package provides a tool for survival analysis using a discrete time
approach with ensemble binary classification.  spect provides a simple interface
consistent with commonly used R data analysis packages, such as caret', a
variety of parameter options to help facilitate search automation, a high degree
of transparency to the end-user - all intermediate data sets and parameters are
made available for further analysis and useful, out-of-the-box visualizations of
model performance.  Methods for transforming survival data into discrete-time
are adapted from the autosurv package by Suresh et al., (2022)

SE2 can detect community structure across scales, making it a good choice for
biological data, which often has hierarchical structure.  Graphs can be passed

regular duration models, split-population duration models are mixture models
that accommodate the presence of a sub-population that is not at risk for
failure, e.g. cancer patients who have been cured by treatment.  This package
implements Weibull and Loglogistic forms for the duration component, and focuses
on data with time-varying covariates.  These models were originally formulated
in Boag (1949) and Berkson and Gage (1952), and extended in Schmidt and Witte

    (description
     "This package provides functions for Bayesian Predictive Stacking within the
Bayesian transfer learning framework for geospatial artificial systems, as
introduced in \"Bayesian Transfer Learning for Artificially Intelligent
Geospatial Systems: A Predictive Stacking Approach\" (Presicce and Banerjee,
2024) <doi:10.48550/@code{arXiv.2410.09504>}.  This methodology enables
efficient Bayesian geostatistical modeling, utilizing predictive stacking to
improve inference across spatial datasets.  The core functions leverage C++ for
high-performance computation, making the framework well-suited for large-scale
spatial data analysis in parallel and distributed computing environments.
Designed for scalability, it allows seamless application in computationally
demanding scenarios.")

     "This package implements a spatial Bayesian non-parametric factor analysis model
with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
Spatial correlation is introduced in the columns of the factor loadings matrix
using a Bayesian non-parametric prior, the probit stick-breaking process.  Areal
spatial data is modeled using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior and
point-referenced spatial data is treated using a Gaussian process.  The response
variable can be modeled as Gaussian, probit, Tobit, or Binomial (using
Polya-Gamma augmentation).  Temporal correlation is introduced for the latent
factors through a hierarchical structure and can be specified as exponential or
first-order autoregressive.  Full details of the package can be found in the
accompanying vignette.  Furthermore, the details of the package can be found in
\"Bayesian Non-Parametric Factor Analysis for Longitudinal Spatial Surfaces\", by
Berchuck et al (2019), <@code{arXiv:1911.04337>}.  The paper is in press at the

nonproportional hazards (LDDPM), generalized accelerated failure time (GAFT),
and spatially smoothed Polya tree density estimation.  The spatial dependence is
modeled via frailties under PH, AFT, PO, AH and GAFT, and via copulas under
LDDPM and PH. Model choice is carried out via the logarithm of the pseudo
marginal likelihood (LPML), the deviance information criterion (DIC), and the
Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC).  See Zhou, Hanson and Zhang (2020)

We use a spatial Poisson regression model to link the spatial counts and

penalty, we implemented the penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) and the approximate
penalized loglikelihood (APL) methods.  The proposed methods can automatically
select important covariates, while adjusting for possible spatial correlations
among the responses.  More details are available in Xie et al. (2018,
<@code{arXiv:1809.06418>}).  The package also contains the Lyme disease dataset,
which consists of the disease case data from 2006 to 2011, and demographic data
and land cover data in Virginia.  The Lyme disease case data were collected by
the Virginia Department of Health.  The demographic data (e.g., population
density, median income, and average age) are from the 2010 census.  Land cover
data were obtained from the Multi-Resolution Land Cover Consortium for 2006.")

    (description
     "Automatic generation and selection of spatial predictors for spatial regression
with Random Forest.  Spatial predictors are surrogates of variables driving the
spatial structure of a response variable.  The package offers two methods to
generate spatial predictors from a distance matrix among training cases: 1)
Moran's Eigenvector Maps (MEMs; Dray, Legendre, and Peres-Neto 2006
<DOI:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.02.015>): computed as the eigenvectors of a
weighted matrix of distances; 2) RFsp (Hengl et al. <DOI:10.7717/peerj.5518>):
columns of the distance matrix used as spatial predictors.  Spatial predictors
help minimize the spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals and facilitate
an honest assessment of the importance scores of the non-spatial predictors.
Additionally, functions to reduce multicollinearity, identify relevant variable
interactions, tune random forest hyperparameters, assess model transferability
via spatial cross-validation, and explore model results via partial dependence
curves and interaction surfaces are included in the package.  The modelling
functions are built around the highly efficient ranger package (Wright and
Ziegler 2017 <DOI:10.18637/jss.v077.i01>).")

user-specified longitude and latitude coordinates.  The function first validates
the input longitude and latitude values, ensuring they fall within the
appropriate geographic ranges.  It then creates a polygon from the coordinates
and determines the appropriate Universal Transverse Mercator zone based on the
provided hemisphere and longitude values.  Subsequently, transforming the input
Shapefile to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection when necessary.
Finally, a spatial grid is generated with the specified interval and saved as a
Shapefile.  For method details see, Brus,D.J.(2022).<DOI:10.1201/9781003258940>.
 The function takes into account crucial parameters such as the hemisphere
(north or south), desired grid interval, and the output Shapefile path.  The
developed function is an efficient tool, simplifying the process of empty
spatial grid generation for applications such as, geo-statistical analysis,
digital soil mapping product generation, etc.  Whether for environmental
studies, urban planning, or any other geo-spatial analysis, this package caters

Gamma-Count (GC) model.  The GC model is well-suited for modeling dispersed
count data, including under-dispersed or over-dispersed counts, or counts with
equivalent dispersion, using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA).
The package includes functions for generating data from the GC model, as well as
spatially correlated versions of the model.  See Nadifar, Baghishani, Fallah

    (description
     "Performance of functional kriging, cokriging, optimal sampling and simulation
for spatial prediction of functional data.  The framework of spatial prediction,
optimal sampling and simulation are extended from scalar to functional data.
@code{SpatFD} is based on the Karhunen-LoÃ¨ve expansion that allows to represent
the observed functions in terms of its empirical functional principal
components.  Based on this approach, the functional auto-covariances and
cross-covariances required for spatial functional predictions and optimal
sampling, are completely determined by the sum of the spatial auto-covariances
and cross-covariances of the respective score components.  The package provides
new classes of data and functions for modeling spatial dependence structure
among curves.  The spatial prediction of curves at unsampled locations can be
carried out using two types of predictors, and both of them report, the
respective variances of the prediction error.  In addition, there is a function
for the determination of spatial locations sampling configuration that ensures
minimum variance of spatial functional prediction.  There are also two functions
for plotting predicted curves at each location and mapping the surface at each
time point, respectively.  References Bohorquez, M., Giraldo, R., and Mateu, J.

     "Modeling spatial dependencies in dependent variables, extending traditional
spatial regression approaches.  It allows for the joint modeling of both the
mean and the variance of the dependent variable, incorporating semiparametric
effects in both models.  Based on generalized additive models (GAM), the package
enables the inclusion of non-parametric terms while maintaining the classical
theoretical framework of spatial regression.  Additionally, it implements the
Generalized Spatial Autoregression (GSAR) model, which extends classical methods
like logistic Spatial Autoregresive Models (SAR), probit Spatial Autoregresive
Models (SAR), and Poisson Spatial Autoregresive Models (SAR), offering greater
flexibility in modeling spatial dependencies and significantly improving
computational efficiency and the statistical properties of the estimators.

    (description
     "Functionality for spatio-temporal modeling of large data sets is provided.  A
Gaussian process in space and time is defined through a stochastic partial
differential equation (SPDE).  The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and
after discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space model is
obtained.  When doing inference, the main computational difficulty consists in
evaluating the likelihood and in sampling from the full conditional of the
spectral coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process.  In
comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-temporal covariance
function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally advantageous.  See
Sigrist, Kuensch, and Stahel (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12061> for more
information on the methodology.  This package aims at providing tools for two
different modeling approaches.  First, the SPDE based spatio-temporal model can
be used as a component in a customized hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM).  The
functions of the package then provide parameterizations of the process part of
the model as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing
inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC algorithm implemented
in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any
additional modeling.  The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or
a censored distribution with point mass at zero.  Covariates can be included in
the model through a regression term.")

     "The Stratified-Petersen Analysis System (SPAS) is designed to estimate abundance
in two-sample capture-recapture experiments where the capture and recaptures are
stratified.  This is a generalization of the simple Lincoln-Petersen estimator.
Strata may be defined in time or in space or both, and the s strata in which
marking takes place may differ from the t strata in which recoveries take place.
 When s=t, SPAS reduces to the method described by Darroch (1961)
<doi:10.2307/2332748>.  When s<t, SPAS implements the methods described in
Plante, Rivest, and Tremblay (1988) <doi:10.2307/2533994>.  Schwarz and Taylor
(1998) <doi:10.1139/f97-238> describe the use of SPAS in estimating return of
salmon stratified by time and geography.  A related package, BTSPAS, deals with
temporal stratification where a spline is used to model the distribution of the
population over time as it passes the second capture location.  This is the
R-version of the (now obsolete) standalone Windows program of the same name.")

    (description
     "This package implements variational Bayesian algorithms to perform scalable
variable selection for sparse, high-dimensional linear and logistic regression
models.  Features include a novel prioritized updating scheme, which uses a
preliminary estimator of the variational means during initialization to generate
an updating order prioritizing large, more relevant, coefficients.  Sparsity is
induced via spike-and-slab priors with either Laplace or Gaussian slabs.  By
default, the heavier-tailed Laplace density is used.  Formal derivations of the
algorithms and asymptotic consistency results may be found in Kolyan Ray and
Botond Szabo (JASA 2020) and Kolyan Ray, Botond Szabo, and Gabriel Clara

ranked sparsity is a philosophy with methods primarily useful for variable

context of trying to perform variable selection in the presence of interactions
and/or polynomials.  Ultimately, this package attempts to facilitate dealing
with cumbersome interactions and polynomials while not avoiding them entirely.

     "The SPARRA risk score (Scottish Patients At Risk of admission and Re-Admission)
estimates yearly risk of emergency hospital admission using electronic health
records on a monthly basis for most of the Scottish population.  This package
implements a suite of functions used to analyse the behaviour and performance of
the score, focusing particularly on differential performance over
demographically-defined groups.  It includes useful utility functions to plot
receiver-operator-characteristic, precision-recall and calibration curves, draw
stock human figures, estimate counterfactual quantities without the need to
re-compute risk scores, to simulate a semi-realistic dataset.  Our manuscript

problem by providing tools to simulate spatial Bernoulli networks as proposed in
Carter T. Butts (2002, ISBN:978-0-493-72676-2), \"Spatial models of large-scale
interpersonal networks.\" Using this package, network analysts can simulate a
spatial point process or sequence with a given number of nodes inside a
geographical boundary and estimate the probability of a tie formation between
all node pairs.  When simulating a network, an analyst can choose between five
spatial interaction functions.  The package also enables quick comparison of
summary statistics for simulated networks and provides simple to use plotting
methods for its classes that return plots which can be further refined with the
ggplot2 package.")

    (description
     "This package provides an all-in-one solution for automatic classification of
sound events using convolutional neural networks (CNN).  The main purpose is to
provide a sound classification workflow, from annotating sound events in
recordings to training and automating model usage in real-life situations.
Using the package requires a pre-compiled collection of recordings with sound
events of interest and it can be employed for: 1) Annotation: create a database
of annotated recordings, 2) Training: prepare train data from annotated
recordings and fit CNN models, 3) Classification: automate the use of the fitted
model for classifying new recordings.  By using automatic feature selection and
a user-friendly GUI for managing data and training/deploying models, this
package is intended to be used by a broad audience as it does not require
specific expertise in statistics, programming or sound analysis.  Please refer
to the vignette for further information.  Gibb, R., et al. (2019)

While historically the State of the Union was often a written document, in
recent decades it has always taken the form of an oral address to a joint
session of the United States Congress.  This package provides the raw text from
every such address with the intention of being used for meaningful examples of
text analysis in R. The corpus is well suited to the task as it is historically
important, includes material intended to be read and material intended to be
spoken, and it falls in the public domain.  As the corpus spans over two
centuries it is also a good test of how well various methods hold up to the
idiosyncrasies of historical texts.  Associated data about each address, such as
the year, president, party, and format, are also included.")

     "Estimate the abundance of cell clones from the distribution of lengths of DNA
fragments (as created by sonication, whence `@code{sonicLength}').  The
algorithm in \"Estimating abundances of retroviral insertion sites from DNA
fragment length data\" by Berry CC, Gillet NA, Melamed A, Gormley N, Bangham CR,
Bushman FD. Bioinformatics; 2012 Mar 15;28(6):755-62 is implemented.  The
experimental setting and estimation details are described in detail there.
Briefly, integration of new DNA in a host genome (due to retroviral infection or
gene therapy) can be tracked using DNA sequencing, potentially allowing
characterization of the abundance of individual cell clones bearing distinct
integration sites.  The locations of integration sites can be determined by
fragmenting the host DNA (via sonication or fragmentase), breaking the newly
integrated DNA at a known sequence, amplifying the fragments containing both
host and integrated DNA, sequencing those amplicons, then mapping the host
sequences to positions on the reference genome.  The relative number of
fragments containing a given position in the host genome estimates the relative
abundance of cells hosting the corresponding integration site, but that number
is not available and the count of amplicons per fragment varies widely.
However, the expected number of distinct fragment lengths is a function of the
abundance of cells hosting an integration site at a given position and a certain
nuisance parameter.  The algorithm implicitly estimates that function to
estimate the relative abundance.")

microbial activity, nutritional element supply, structural stability and aid for
crop production.  Since soil functions can be linked to 80% of ecosystem
services, conservation of degraded land should strive to restore not only the
capacity of soil to sustain flora but also ecosystem provisions.  The primary
ecosystem services of soil are carbon sequestration, food or biomass production,
provision of microbial habitat, nutrient recycling.  However, the actual
magnitude of soil functions provided by agricultural land uses has never been
quantified.  Nutrient supply capacity (NSC) is a measure of nutrient dynamics in
restored land uses.  Carbon accumulation proficiency (CAP) is a measure of
ecosystem carbon sequestration.  Biological activity index (BAI) is the average
of responses of all enzyme activities in treated land over control/reference
land.  The CAP parameter investigates how land uses may affect carbon flows,
retention, and sequestration.  The CAP provides a signal for C cycles, flows,
and the systems relative operational supremacy.")

usually time series data, which may occur singly or in batches, and may be
univariate or multivariate.  These methods are designed to detect changes in the
process, which may occur as changes in location (mean or median), changes in
scale (standard deviation, or variance), or other changes of interest in the
distribution of the observations, over the time observed.  They usually apply to
large data sets, so computations need to be simple enough to be done in a
reasonable time on a computer, and easily updated as each new observation (or
batch of observations) becomes available.  Some examples and more detail in SNS
is presented in the work by Conover et al (2019) <@code{arXiv:1901.04443>}.")

     "Stochastic Newton Sampler (SNS) is a Metropolis-Hastings-based, Markov Chain
Monte Carlo sampler for twice differentiable, log-concave probability density
functions (PDFs) where the proposal density function is a multivariate Gaussian
resulting from a second-order Taylor-series expansion of log-density around the
current point.  The mean of the Gaussian proposal is the full Newton-Raphson
step from the current point.  A Boolean flag allows for switching from SNS to
Newton-Raphson optimization (by choosing the mean of proposal function as next
point).  This can be used during burn-in to get close to the mode of the PDF
(which is unique due to concavity).  For high-dimensional densities, mixing can
be improved via state space partitioning strategy, in which SNS is applied to
disjoint subsets of state space, wrapped in a Gibbs cycle.  Numerical
differentiation is available when analytical expressions for gradient and
Hessian are not available.  Facilities for validation and numerical
differentiation of log-density are provided.  Note: Formerly available versions

     "Linkage disequilibrium visualizations of up to several hundreds of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), annotated with chromosomic positions and gene
names.  Two types of plots are available for small numbers of SNPs (<40) and for
large numbers (tested up to 500).  Both can be extended by combining other
ggplots, e.g. association studies results, and functions enable to directly
visualize the effect of SNP selection methods, as minor allele frequency
filtering and @code{TagSNP} selection, with a second correlation heatmap.  The
SNPs correlations are computed on Genotype Data objects from the GWASTools
package using the SNPRelate package, and the plots are customizable ggplot2 and
gtable objects and are annotated using the @code{biomaRt} package.  Usage is
detailed in the vignette with example data and results from up to 500 SNPs of
1,200 scans are in Charlon T. (2019)

    (description
     "We provide full functionality to smooth L1 penalized regression operators and to
compute regression estimates thereof.  For this, the objective function of a
user-specified regression operator is first smoothed using Nesterov smoothing
(see Y. Nesterov (2005) <doi:10.1007/s10107-004-0552-5>), resulting in a
modified objective function with explicit gradients everywhere.  The smoothed
objective function and its gradient are minimized via BFGS, and the obtained
minimizer is returned.  Using Nesterov smoothing, the smoothed objective
function can be made arbitrarily close to the original (unsmoothed) one.  In
particular, the Nesterov approach has the advantage that it comes with explicit
accuracy bounds, both on the L1/L2 difference of the unsmoothed to the smoothed
objective functions as well as on their respective minimizers (see G. Hahn, S.M.
Lutz, N. Laha, C. Lange (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.09.17.301788>).  A progressive
smoothing approach is provided which iteratively smoothes the objective
function, resulting in more stable regression estimates.  A function to perform
cross validation for selection of the regularization parameter is provided.")

snapshots of different preprocessing steps.  The smallsets package builds this
visualisation from a user's dataset and preprocessing code located in an R', R
Markdown', Python', or Jupyter Notebook file.  Users simply add structured
comments with snapshot instructions to the preprocessing code.  One optional
feature in smallsets requires installation of the Gurobi optimisation software

which leverages real cartographic information for programmatic and visual
encoding of spatiotemporal population dynamics on real geographic landscapes.
Population genetic models are then automatically executed by the S@code{LiM}
software by Haller et al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/molbev/msy228> behind the scenes,
using a custom built-in simulation S@code{LiM} script.  Additionally, fully
abstract spatial models not tied to a specific geographic location are
supported, and users can also simulate data from standard, non-spatial,
random-mating models.  These can be simulated either with the S@code{LiM}
built-in back-end script, or using an efficient coalescent population genetics
simulator msprime by Baumdicker et al. (2022) <doi:10.1093/genetics/iyab229>
with a custom-built Python script bundled with the R package.  Simulated genomic
data is saved in a tree-sequence format and can be loaded, manipulated, and
summarised using tree-sequence functionality via an R interface to the Python
module tskit by Kelleher et al. (2019) <doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0483-y>.
Complete model configuration, simulation and analysis pipelines can be therefore
constructed without a need to leave the R environment, eliminating friction
between disparate tools for population genetic simulations and data analysis.")

In the scenario when m == n and each cell value in matrix is a valid distance
metric, this is equivalent to a k-means problem.  The selective k-means extends
the k-means problem in the sense that it is possible to have m != n, often the
case m < n which implies the search is limited within a small subset of rows.
Also, the selective k-means extends the k-means problem in the sense that the
instance in row set can be instance not seen in the column set, e.g., select 2
from 3 internet service provider (row) for 5 houses (column) such that minimize
the overall cost (cell value) - overall cost is the sum of the column minimal of
the selected 2 service provider.")

    (synopsis "Handling Heteroskedasticity in the Linear Regression Model")
    (description
     "This package implements numerous methods for testing for, modelling, and
correcting for heteroskedasticity in the classical linear regression model.  The
most novel contribution of the package is found in the functions that implement
the as-yet-unpublished auxiliary linear variance models and auxiliary nonlinear
variance models that are designed to estimate error variances in a
heteroskedastic linear regression model.  These models follow principles of
statistical learning described in Hastie (2009) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-21606-5>.
 The nonlinear version of the model is estimated using quasi-likelihood methods
as described in Seber and Wild (2003, ISBN: 0-471-47135-6).  Bootstrap methods
for approximate confidence intervals for error variances are implemented as
described in Efron and Tibshirani (1993, ISBN: 978-1-4899-4541-9), including
also the expansion technique described in Hesterberg (2014)
<doi:10.1080/00031305.2015.1089789>.  The wild bootstrap employed here follows
the description in Davidson and Flachaire (2008)
<doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2008.08.003>.  Tuning of hyper-parameters makes use of a
golden section search function that is modelled after the MATLAB function of
Zarnowiec (2022)
<https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25919-golden-section-method-algorithm>.
 A methodological description of the algorithm can be found in Fox (2021, ISBN:
978-1-003-00957-3).  There are 25 different functions that implement hypothesis
tests for heteroskedasticity.  These include a test based on Anscombe (1961)

from the scene and suspects to gain evidence of placing a suspect at the crime

scene, and assessing the significance in a likeness that they share.  The

Distribution Models (@code{jSDMs}) for big community data, including @code{eDNA}
data.  The package estimates a full (i.e.  non-latent) @code{jSDM} with
different response distributions (including the traditional multivariate probit
model).  The package allows to perform variation partitioning (VP) / ANOVA on
the fitted models to separate the contribution of environmental, spatial, and
biotic associations.  In addition, the total R-squared can be further
partitioned per species and site to reveal the internal metacommunity structure,
see Leibold et al., <doi:10.1111/oik.08618>.  The internal structure can then be
regressed against environmental and spatial distinctiveness, richness, and
traits to analyze metacommunity assembly processes.  The package includes
support for accounting for spatial autocorrelation and the option to fit
responses using deep neural networks instead of a standard linear predictor.  As
described in Pichler & Hartig (2021) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13687>, scalability
is achieved by using a Monte Carlo approximation of the joint likelihood
implemented via @code{PyTorch} and reticulate', which can be run on CPUs or

     "Carries out a two-level sample selection where the possibility of an initially
selected site not wanting to participate is anticipated, and the site is
optimally replaced.  The procedure aims to reduce bias (and/or loss of external
validity) with respect to the target population.  In selecting units and
sub-units, @code{sitepickR} uses the cube method developed by Deville & TillÃ©',
(2004) <http://www.math.helsinki.fi/msm/banocoss/Deville_Tille_2004.pdf> and
described in TillÃ© (2011)
<https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/12-001-x/2011002/article/11609-eng.pdf?st=5-sx8Q8n>.
 The cube method is a probability sampling method that is designed to satisfy
criteria for balance between the sample and the population.  Recent research has
shown that this method performs well in simulations for studies of educational
programs (see Fay & Olsen (2021, under review).  To implement the cube method,
@code{sitepickR} uses the sampling R package
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=sampling>.  To implement statistical
matching, @code{sitepickR} uses the @code{MatchIt} R package
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=@code{MatchIt>}.")

are based on a @code{pGEM-T} Promega plasmid containing a 104 bp fragment of the

primer pair.  The remaining three datasets contain @code{qPCR} results in the
presence of specific PCR inhibitors: tannic acid, immunoglobulin G (@code{IgG}),
and quercetin, respectively, to assess their effects on the amplification
process.  These datasets are useful for researchers interested in PCR kinetics.

relationships acting in the system, via Maximum likelihood and Wald test, which
can be built starting from the function output.  For theoretical reference see

prediction of features with different activity levels.  For example, we want to
predict differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in single-cell RNA-seq data,
spatial DEGs in spatial transcriptomics data, or differentially accessible
regions (DARs) in single-cell ATAC-seq data. @code{singleCellHaystack} predicts
differentially active features in single cell omics datasets without relying on
the clustering of cells into arbitrary clusters. @code{singleCellHaystack} uses
Kullback-Leibler divergence to find features (e.g., genes, genomic regions, etc)
that are active in subsets of cells that are non-randomly positioned inside an
input space (such as 1D trajectories, 2D tissue sections, multi-dimensional
embeddings, etc).  For the theoretical background of @code{singleCellHaystack}

    (description
     "This package implements two iterative techniques called T3Clus and 3Fkmeans,
aimed at simultaneously clustering objects and a factorial dimensionality
reduction of variables and occasions on three-mode datasets developed by Vichi
et al. (2007) <doi:10.1007/s00357-007-0006-x>.  Also, we provide a convex
combination of these two simultaneous procedures called CT3Clus and based on a
hyperparameter alpha (alpha in [0,1], with 3FKMeans for alpha=0 and T3Clus for
alpha= 1) also developed by Vichi et al. (2007) <doi:10.1007/s00357-007-0006-x>.
 Furthermore, we implemented the traditional tandem procedures of T3Clus
(TWCFTA) and 3FKMeans (TWFCTA) for sequential clustering-factorial decomposition
(TWCFTA), and vice-versa (TWFCTA) proposed by P. Arabie and L. Hubert (1996)

simulation-based approach that extends the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure.
 The methodology provides flexibility in hypothesis testing, accommodates
multiple treatment comparisons, and accounts for correlated endpoints.  Users
can model complex trial scenarios, including parallel and crossover designs,
intra-subject variability, and different equivalence margins.  Monte Carlo
simulations enable accurate estimation of power and type I error rates, ensuring
well-calibrated study designs.  The statistical framework builds on established
methods for equivalence testing and multiple hypothesis testing in
bio-equivalence studies, as described in Schuirmann (1987)

baseline covariates and a treatment variable defined on a continuum, we employ
two-dimensional penalized spline regression on an index-treatment domain, where
the index is defined as a linear combination of the covariates (a single-index).
 An unspecified main effect for the covariates is allowed, which can also be
modeled through a parametric model.  A unique contribution of this work is in
the parsimonious single-index parametrization specifically defined for the
interaction effect term.  We refer to Park, Petkova, Tarpey, and Ogden (2020)
<doi:10.1111/biom.13320> (for the case of a discrete treatment) and Park,
Petkova, Tarpey, and Ogden (2021) \"A single-index model with a surface-link for
optimizing individualized dose rules\" <@code{arXiv:2006.00267v2>} for detail of
the method.  The model can take a member of the exponential family as a response

     "RNA sequencing analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical
parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be precisely satisfied
in practice.  Methods are often tested by analyzing data that have been
simulated according to the assumed model.  This testing strategy can result in
an overly optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-seq analysis method.  We
develop a data-based simulation algorithm for RNA-seq data.  The vector of read
counts simulated for a given experimental unit has a joint distribution that
closely matches the distribution of a source RNA-seq dataset provided by the
user.  Users control the proportion of genes simulated to be differentially
expressed (DE) and can provide a vector of weights to control the distribution
of effect sizes.  The algorithm requires a matrix of RNA-seq read counts with
large sample sizes in at least two treatment groups.  Many datasets are
available that fit this standard.")

     "Simulating Multistate Movements in River/Heterogeneous Landscapes")
    (description
     "This package provides functions to generate and analyze spatially-explicit
individual-based multistate movements in rivers, heterogeneous and homogeneous
spaces.  This is done by incorporating landscape bias on local behaviour, based
on resistance rasters.  Although originally conceived and designed to simulate
trajectories of species constrained to linear habitats/dendritic ecological
networks (e.g. river networks), the simulation algorithm is built to be highly
flexible and can be applied to any (aquatic, semi-aquatic or terrestrial)
organism, independently on the landscape in which it moves.  Thus, the user will
be able to use the package to simulate movements either in homogeneous
landscapes, heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. semi-aquatic animal moving mainly
along rivers but also using the matrix), or even in highly contrasted landscapes
(e.g. fish in a river network).  The algorithm and its input parameters are the
same for all cases, so that results are comparable.  Simulated trajectories can
then be used as mechanistic null models (Potts & Lewis 2014,
<DOI:10.1098/rspb.2014.0231>) to test a variety of Movement Ecology hypotheses
(Nathan et al.  2008, <DOI:10.1073/pnas.0800375105>), including landscape
effects (e.g. resources, infrastructures) on animal movement and species site
fidelity, or for predictive purposes (e.g. road mortality risk,
dispersal/connectivity).  The package should be relevant to explore a broad
spectrum of ecological phenomena, such as those at the interface of animal
behaviour, management, landscape and movement ecology, disease and invasive
species spread, and population dynamics.")

     "Generate continuous (normal or non-normal), binary, ordinal, and count (Poisson
or Negative Binomial) variables with a specified correlation matrix.  It can
also produce a single continuous variable.  This package can be used to simulate
data sets that mimic real-world situations (i.e.  clinical or genetic data sets,
plasmodes).  All variables are generated from standard normal variables with an
imposed intermediate correlation matrix.  Continuous variables are simulated by
specifying mean, variance, skewness, standardized kurtosis, and fifth and sixth
standardized cumulants using either Fleishman's third-order
(<DOI:10.1007/BF02293811>) or Headrick's fifth-order
(<DOI:10.1016/S0167-9473(02)00072-5>) polynomial transformation.  Binary and
ordinal variables are simulated using a modification of the @code{ordsample()}
function from @code{GenOrd}'.  Count variables are simulated using the inverse
cdf method.  There are two simulation pathways which differ primarily according
to the calculation of the intermediate correlation matrix.  In Correlation
Method 1, the intercorrelations involving count variables are determined using a
simulation based, logarithmic correlation correction (adapting Yahav and
Shmueli's 2012 method, <DOI:10.1002/asmb.901>).  In Correlation Method 2, the
count variables are treated as ordinal (adapting Barbiero and Ferrari's 2015
modification of @code{GenOrd}, <DOI:10.1002/asmb.2072>).  There is an optional
error loop that corrects the final correlation matrix to be within a
user-specified precision value of the target matrix.  The package also includes
functions to calculate standardized cumulants for theoretical distributions or
from real data sets, check if a target correlation matrix is within the possible
correlation bounds (given the distributions of the simulated variables),
summarize results (numerically or graphically), to verify valid power method
pdfs, and to calculate lower standardized kurtosis bounds.")

     "This package provides a major challenge in estimating treatment decision rules
from a randomized clinical trial dataset with covariates measured at baseline
lies in detecting relatively small treatment effect modification-related
variability (i.e., the treatment-by-covariates interaction effects on treatment
outcomes) against a relatively large non-treatment-related variability (i.e.,
the main effects of covariates on treatment outcomes).  The class of
Single-Index Models with Multiple-Links is a novel single-index model
specifically designed to estimate a single-index (a linear combination) of the
covariates associated with the treatment effect modification-related
variability, while allowing a nonlinear association with the treatment outcomes
via flexible link functions.  The models provide a flexible regression approach
to developing treatment decision rules based on patients data measured at
baseline.  We refer to Park, Petkova, Tarpey, and Ogden (2020)

simulator engages the problem from a purely computational perspective.  It
assumes no statistical models such as copulas or parametric distributions, and
can approximate the target correlations regardless of theoretical feasibility.
The algorithm integrates and advances the Iman-Conover (1982) approach
<doi:10.1080/03610918208812265> and the Ruscio-Kaczetow iteration (2008)
<doi:10.1080/00273170802285693>.  Package functions are carefully implemented in
C++ for squeezing computing speed, suitable for large input in a manycore
environment.  Precision of the approximation and computing speed both
substantially outperform various CRAN packages to date.  Benchmarks are detailed
in function examples.  A simple heuristic algorithm is additionally designed to
optimize the joint distribution in the post-simulation stage.  The heuristic
demonstrated good potential of achieving the same level of precision of
approximation without the enhanced Iman-Conover-Ruscio-Kaczetow.  The package
contains a copy of Permuted Congruential Generator.")

    (description
     "This package provides an efficient and very flexible framework to conduct
data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large scale disease spread
simulations.  The framework integrates infection dynamics in subpopulations as
continuous-time Markov chains using the Gillespie stochastic simulation
algorithm and incorporates available data such as births, deaths and movements
as scheduled events at predefined time-points.  Using C code for the numerical
solvers and @code{OpenMP} (if available) to divide work over multiple processors
ensures high performance when simulating a sample outcome.  One of our design
goals was to make the package extendable and enable usage of the numerical
solvers from other R extension packages in order to facilitate complex
epidemiological research.  The package contains template models and can be
extended with user-defined models.  For more details see the paper by Widgren,
Bauer, Eriksson and Engblom (2019) <doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i12>.  The package
also provides functionality to fit models to time series data using the
Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo ('ABC-SMC') algorithm of

    (description
     "Generate continuous (normal, non-normal, or mixture distributions), binary,
ordinal, and count (regular or zero-inflated, Poisson or Negative Binomial)
variables with a specified correlation matrix, or one continuous variable with a
mixture distribution.  This package can be used to simulate data sets that mimic
real-world clinical or genetic data sets (i.e., plasmodes, as in Vaughan et al.,
2009 <DOI:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.032>).  The methods extend those found in the
@code{SimMultiCorrData} R package.  Standard normal variables with an imposed
intermediate correlation matrix are transformed to generate the desired
distributions.  Continuous variables are simulated using either Fleishman
(1978)'s third order <DOI:10.1007/BF02293811> or Headrick (2002)'s fifth order
<DOI:10.1016/S0167-9473(02)00072-5> polynomial transformation method (the power
method transformation, PMT).  Non-mixture distributions require the user to
specify mean, variance, skewness, standardized kurtosis, and standardized fifth
and sixth cumulants.  Mixture distributions require these inputs for the
component distributions plus the mixing probabilities.  Simulation occurs at the
component level for continuous mixture distributions.  The target correlation
matrix is specified in terms of correlations with components of continuous
mixture variables.  These components are transformed into the desired mixture
variables using random multinomial variables based on the mixing probabilities.
However, the package provides functions to approximate expected correlations
with continuous mixture variables given target correlations with the components.
 Binary and ordinal variables are simulated using a modification of
@code{ordsample()} in package @code{GenOrd}'.  Count variables are simulated
using the inverse CDF method.  There are two simulation pathways which calculate
intermediate correlations involving count variables differently.  Correlation
Method 1 adapts Yahav and Shmueli's 2012 method <DOI:10.1002/asmb.901> and
performs best with large count variable means and positive correlations or small
means and negative correlations.  Correlation Method 2 adapts Barbiero and
Ferrari's 2015 modification of the @code{GenOrd} package <DOI:10.1002/asmb.2072>
and performs best under the opposite scenarios.  The optional error loop may be
used to improve the accuracy of the final correlation matrix.  The package also
contains functions to calculate the standardized cumulants of continuous mixture
distributions, check parameter inputs, calculate feasible correlation
boundaries, and summarize and plot simulated variables.")

obtaining the membership function of main statistics, such as mean, variance,

advantages of Sim.PLFN package are: (1) Easily generating / simulation a random
sample of PLFN, (2) drawing the membership functions of the simulated PLFNs or
the membership function of the statistical result, and (3) Considering the
simulated PLFNs for arithmetic operation or importing into some statistical

effects among latent variables, thus allowing for more precise definition and

while silp may exhibit instability with smaller sample sizes and lower
reliability scores (e.g., N = 100, omega = 0.7), implementing nearest positive
definite matrix correction and bootstrap confidence interval estimation can
significantly ameliorate this volatility.  When these adjustments are applied,
silp achieves estimations akin in quality to those derived from LMS. In

explore complex relational structures between variables without resorting to

sequentially-linked records, primitives are basic atomic elements and both can
model many forms and be grouped into hierarchical structures.  The universal
models SC0 (structural) and SC (labelled, relational) are composed of edges and
can represent any hierarchical form.  Specialist models PATH', ARC and TRI
provide the most common intermediate forms used for converting from one form to
another.  The methods are inspired by the simplicial complex

using the well known Gaussian graphical model (GGM) in a time-efficient manner.
We focus on the high-dimensional settings where p (the number of genes) is
allowed to be far larger than n (the number of subjects).  Four main approaches
are supported in this package: (1) the bivariate nodewise scaled Lasso (Ren et
al (2015) <doi:10.1214/14-AOS1286>) (2) the de-sparsified nodewise scaled Lasso
(Jankova and van de Geer (2017) <doi:10.1007/s11749-016-0503-5>) (3) the
de-sparsified graphical Lasso (Jankova and van de Geer (2015)

    (description
     "In various domains, many datasets exhibit both high variable dependency and
group structures, which necessitates their simultaneous estimation.  This
package provides functions for two subgroup identification methods based on
penalized functions, both of which utilize factor model structures to adapt to
data with cross-sectional dependency.  The first method is the Subgroup
Identification with Latent Factor Structure Method (SILFSM) we proposed.  By
employing Center-Augmented Regularization and factor structures, the SILFSM
effectively eliminates data dependencies while identifying subgroups within
datasets.  For this model, we offer optimization functions based on two
different methods: Coordinate Descent and our newly developed Difference of
Convex-Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DC-ADMM) algorithms; the
latter can be applied to cases where the distance function in Center-Augmented
Regularization takes L1 and L2 forms.  The other method is the Factor-Adjusted
Pairwise Fusion Penalty (FA-PFP) model, which incorporates factor augmentation
into the Pairwise Fusion Penalty (PFP) developed by Ma, S. and Huang, J. (2017)
<doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1148039>.  Additionally, we provide a function for
the Standard CAR (S-CAR) method, which does not consider the dependency and is
for comparative analysis with other approaches.  Furthermore, functions based on
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of the SILFSM and the FA-PFP method are
also included in SILFS for selecting tuning parameters.  For more details of
Subgroup Identification with Latent Factor Structure Method, please refer to He
et al. (2024) <doi:10.48550/@code{arXiv.2407.00882>}.")

biological processes or pathways on the systems(i.e., organism, organ, tissue,

collections of single genes and treat all genes in a pathway as equally
informative.  However, this can lead to identifying spurious pathways as
statistically significant since components are often shared amongst pathways.
SIGORA seeks to avoid this pitfall by focusing on genes or gene pairs that are
(as a combination) specific to a single pathway.  In relying on such pathway
gene-pair signatures (Pathway-GPS), SIGORA inherently uses the status of other
genes in the experimental context to identify the most relevant pathways.  The
current version allows for pathway analysis of human and mouse datasets.  In
addition, it contains pre-computed Pathway-GPS data for pathways in the KEGG and
Reactome pathway repositories and mechanisms for extracting GPS for

semiparametric and nonparametric approaches consider two scenarios: (1) the mark
is fully observed in all subjects who experience the event of interest, and (2)
the mark is subject to missingness-at-random in subjects who experience the
event of interest.  For models with missing marks, estimators are implemented
based on (i) inverse probability weighting (IPW) of complete cases (for the
semiparametric framework), and (ii) augmentation of the IPW estimating functions
by leveraging correlations between the mark and auxiliary data to impute the
augmentation term for subjects with missing marks (for both the semiparametric
and nonparametric framework).  The augmented IPW estimators are doubly robust
and recommended for use with incomplete mark data.  The semiparametric methods
make two key assumptions: (i) the time-to-event is assumed to be conditionally
independent of the mark given treatment, and (ii) the weight function in the
semiparametric density ratio/biased sampling model is assumed to be exponential.
 Diagnostic testing procedures for evaluating validity of both assumptions are
implemented.  Summary and plotting functions are provided for estimation and
inferential results.")

The shrinkage priors that are supported are Gaussian (ridge) priors, Laplace

horseshoe priors (Carvalho, et al., 2010; <DOI:10.1093/biomet/asq017>).  These
priors include an option for grouped regularization of different subsets of
parameters (Meier et al., 2008; <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00627.x>).  F
priors are used for the penalty parameters lambda^2 (Mulder and Pericchi, 2018

    (description
     "The predictive value of a statistical model can often be improved by applying
shrinkage methods.  This can be achieved, e.g., by regularized regression or
empirical Bayes approaches.  Various types of shrinkage factors can also be
estimated after a maximum likelihood.  While global shrinkage modifies all
regression coefficients by the same factor, parameterwise shrinkage factors
differ between regression coefficients.  With variables which are either highly
correlated or associated with regard to contents, such as several columns of a
design matrix describing a nonlinear effect, parameterwise shrinkage factors are
not interpretable and a compromise between global and parameterwise shrinkage,
termed joint shrinkage', is a useful extension.  A computational shortcut to
resampling-based shrinkage factor estimation based on DFBETA residuals can be
applied.  Global, parameterwise and joint shrinkage for models fitted by
@code{lm()}, @code{glm()}, @code{coxph()}, or @code{mfp()} is available.")

<doi:10.1007/978-3-031-27781-8_7>).  The procedures differ in how the most
informative items are selected for the inclusion in the STF, either by
considering their item information functions without considering any specific
level of the latent trait (typical procedure) or by considering their
informativeness with respect to specific levels of the latent trait, denoted as
theta targets (the newly introduced procedure).  Regarding the latter procedure,
three methods are implemented for the definition of the theta targets: (i) theta
targets are defined by segmenting the latent trait in equal intervals and
considering the midpoint of each interval (equal interval procedure, eip), (ii)
by clustering the latent trait to obtain unequal intervals and considering the
centroids of the clusters as the theta targets (unequal intervals procedure,
uip), and (iii) by letting the user set the specific theta targets of interest
(user-defined procedure, udp).  For further details on the procedure, please
refer to Epifania, Anselmi & Robusto (2022) <doi:10.1007/978-3-031-27781-8_7>.")

the ant colony algorithm randomly selects items to build a model of a specified
length, then updates the probability of item selection according to the fit of
the best model within each set of searches.  The algorithm continues until the
same items are selected by multiple ants a given number of times in a row.  On
the other hand, the Tabu search changes one parameter at a time to be either
free, constrained, or fixed while keeping track of the changes made and putting
changes that result in worse fit in a \"tabu\" list so that the algorithm does not
revisit them for some number of searches.  See Leite, Huang, & Marcoulides
(2008) <doi:10.1080/00273170802285743> for an applied example of the ant colony

Although it can be extended to other areas, this also forms the core area for
application of the package.  Shoreline dating is based on the present-day
elevation of a site, a reconstruction of past relative sea-level change, and
empirically derived estimates of the likely elevation of the sites above the
contemporaneous sea-level when they were in use.  The geographical and temporal
coverage of the method thus follows from the availability of local geological
reconstructions of shoreline displacement and the degree to which the
settlements to be dated have been located on or close to the shoreline when they
were in use.  Methods for numerical treatment and visualisation of the dates are
provided, along with basic tools for visualising and evaluating the location of
sites.")

create their own.  This latter flexibility allows @code{shinySIR} to be applied
to simple ODEs from any discipline.  The package is a useful teaching tool as
students can visualize how changing different parameters can impact model
dynamics, with minimal knowledge of coding in R. The built-in models are
inspired by those featured in Keeling and Rohani (2008)

that guides a user step-by-step through an analysis.  The shinymgr app builder
\"stitches\" shiny modules together so that outputs from one module serve as
inputs to the next, creating an analysis pipeline that is easy to implement and
maintain.  Users of shinymgr apps can save analyses as an RDS file that fully
reproduces the analytic steps and can be ingested into an R Markdown report for
rapid reporting.  In short, developers use the shinymgr framework to write
modules and seamlessly combine them into shiny apps, and users of these apps can
execute reproducible analyses that can be incorporated into reports for rapid
dissemination.")

dashboard or simple Shiny app.  Then you can instantly start building cohorts
using multiple filters of different types, filtering datasets, and filtering
steps.  Filters can be complex and data-specific, and together with multiple
filtering steps you can use complex filtering rules.  The cohort-building
sidebar panel allows you to easily work with filters, add and remove filtering
steps.  It helps you with handling missing values during filtering, and provides
instant filtering feedback with filter feedback plots.  The GUI panel is not
only compatible with native shiny bookmarking, but also provides reproducible R
code.")

    (description
     "An exact method for computing the Poisson-Binomial Distribution (PBD).  The
package provides a function for generating a random sample from the PBD, as well
as two distinct approaches for computing the density, distribution, and quantile
functions of the PBD. The first method uses direct-convolution, or a
dynamic-programming approach which is numerically stable but can be slow for a
large input due to its quadratic complexity.  The second method is much faster
on large inputs thanks to its use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based
convolutions.  Notably in this case the package uses an exponential shift to
practically guarantee the relative accuracy of the computation of an arbitrarily
small tail of the PBD -- something that FFT-based methods often struggle with.
This @code{ShiftConvolvePoiBin} method is described in Peres, Lee and Keich
(2020) <@code{arXiv:2004.07429>} where it is also shown to be competitive with
the fastest implementations for exactly computing the entire Poisson-Binomial

     "Compute the frequency distribution of a search term in a series of texts.  For
example, Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a total of 60 Sherlock Holmes stories,
comprised of 54 short stories and 4 longer novels.  I wanted to test my own
subjective impression that, in many of the stories, Sherlock Holmes popularity
was used as bait to induce the reader to read a story that is essentially not
primarily a Sherlock Holmes story.  I used the term \"Holmes\" as a search
pattern, since Watson would frequently address him by name, or use his name to
describe something that he was doing.  My hypothesis is that the frequency
distribution of the search pattern \"Holmes\" is a good proxy for the degree to
which a story is or is not truly a Sherlock Holmes story.  The results are
presented in a manuscript that is available as a vignette and online at
<https://barryzee.github.io/Concordance/index.html>.")

map of the cross section surface with chemically distinct phases separated by
phase analysis.  It proceeds by a step-by-step process described in the paper,
by which digitized growth increments are used to calculate changes in shell
height, shell thickness, shell volume, shell mass and shell growth rate through
the bivalve's life time.  Then, results of this growth modelling are combined
with the trace element mapping results to trace the incorporation of trace
elements into the bivalve shell.  Results of various modelling parameters can be

modeling is carried out along a sliding window through the data and yields
estimates of the day of the year (Julian Day) and local growth rate for each

propagated and pooled to obtain a confidence envelope around the age of each
data point in the shell.  The end result is a shell chronology consisting of
estimated ages of shell formation relative to the annual cycle with their
uncertainties.  All formulae in the package serve this purpose, but the user can
customize the model (e.g. number of days in a year and the mineralogy of the
shell carbonate) through input parameters.")

for a single parameter from an expert or a group of experts.  The expert
provides a small number of probability judgements, corresponding to points on
his or her cumulative distribution function.  A range of parametric
distributions can then be fitted and displayed, with feedback provided in the
form of fitted probabilities and percentiles.  For multiple experts, a weighted
linear pool can be calculated.  Also includes functions for eliciting beliefs
about population distributions; eliciting multivariate distributions using a
Gaussian copula; eliciting a Dirichlet distribution; eliciting distributions for
variance parameters in a random effects meta-analysis model; survival
extrapolation.  R Shiny apps for most of the methods are included.")

    (description
     "The Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) provides the theoretical background to
ensure that a supervised algorithm generalizes the mapping f:X -> Y given f is
selected from its search space bias F. This formal result depends on the
Shattering coefficient function N(F,2n) to upper bound the empirical risk
minimization principle, from which one can estimate the necessary training
sample size to ensure the probabilistic learning convergence and, most
importantly, the characterization of the capacity of F, including its under and
overfitting abilities while addressing specific target problems.  In this
context, we propose a new approach to estimate the maximal number of hyperplanes
required to shatter a given sample, i.e., to separate every pair of points from
one another, based on the recent contributions by Har-Peled and Jones in the
dataset partitioning scenario, and use such foundation to analytically compute
the Shattering coefficient function for both binary and multi-class problems.
As main contributions, one can use our approach to study the complexity of the
search space bias F, estimate training sample sizes, and parametrize the number
of hyperplanes a learning algorithm needs to address some supervised task, what
is specially appealing to deep neural networks.  Reference: de Mello, R.F.

    (description
     "This R package introduces Weighted Mean SHapley Additive @code{exPlanations}
(WMSHAP), an innovative method for calculating SHAP values for a grid of
fine-tuned base-learner machine learning models as well as stacked ensembles, a
method not previously available due to the common reliance on single
best-performing models.  By integrating the weighted mean SHAP values from
individual base-learners comprising the ensemble or individual base-learners in
a tuning grid search, the package weights SHAP contributions according to each
model's performance, assessed by multiple either R squared (for both regression
and classification models).  alternatively, this software also offers weighting
SHAP values based on the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR), the area
under the curve (AUC), and F2 measures for binary classifiers.  It further
extends this framework to implement weighted confidence intervals for weighted
mean SHAP values, offering a more comprehensive and robust feature importance
evaluation over a grid of machine learning models, instead of solely computing
SHAP values for the best model.  This methodology is particularly beneficial for
addressing the severe class imbalance (class rarity) problem by providing a
transparent, generalized measure of feature importance that mitigates the risk
of reporting SHAP values for an overfitted or biased model and maintains
robustness under severe class imbalance, where there is no universal criteria of
identifying the absolute best model.  Furthermore, the package implements
hypothesis testing to ascertain the statistical significance of SHAP values for
individual features, as well as comparative significance testing of SHAP
contributions between features.  Additionally, it tackles a critical gap in
feature selection literature by presenting criteria for the automatic feature
selection of the most important features across a grid of models or stacked
ensembles, eliminating the need for arbitrary determination of the number of top
features to be extracted.  This utility is invaluable for researchers analyzing
feature significance, particularly within severely imbalanced outcomes where
conventional methods fall short.  Moreover, it is also expected to report
democratic feature importance across a grid of models, resulting in a more
comprehensive and generalizable feature selection.  The package further
implements a novel method for visualizing SHAP values both at subject level and
feature level as well as a plot for feature selection based on the weighted mean
SHAP ratios.")

While several R packages have been developed to interface sigma.js', all were
developed for v1.x.x and none have migrated to v2.4.0 nor are they planning to.
This package builds upon the @code{sigmaNet} package, and users familiar with it
will recognize the similar design approach.  Two extensions have been added to
the classic sigma.js visualizations by overriding the underlying
@code{JavaScript} code, enabling to draw a frame around node labels, and to
display labels on multiple lines by parsing line breaks.  Other additional
functionalities that did not require overriding sigma.js code include toggling
node visibility when clicked using a node attribute and highlighting specific
edges.  sigma.js is currently preparing a stable release v3.0.0, and this
package plans to update to it when it is available.")

vectors with sum of components equal to 1).  The Dirichlet distribution can be
constructed from a random vector of independent Gamma variables divided by their
sum.  The SGB follows the same construction with generalized Gamma instead of
Gamma variables.  The Dirichlet exponents are supplemented by an overall shape
parameter and a vector of scales.  The scale vector is itself a composition and
can be modeled with auxiliary variables through a log-ratio transformation.

generalization to weighted graphs of the graph search algorithm Lexicographic
Breadth-First Search (Lex-BFS), a variant of Breadth-First Search.  The SFS
algorithm reduces to Lex-BFS when applied to binary matrices (or, equivalently,
unweighted graphs).  Hence this library can be also considered for Lex-BFS
applications such as recognition of graph classes like chordal or unit interval
graphs.  In fact, the SFS seriation algorithm implemented in this package is a
multisweep algorithm, which consists in repeating a finite number of SFS
iterations (at most n sweeps for a matrix of size n).  If the data matrix has a
Robinsonian structure, then the ranking returned by the multistep SFS algorithm
is a Robinson ordering of the input matrix.  Otherwise the algorithm can be used
as a heuristic to return a ranking partially satisfying the Robinson property.")

@code{sfFDR} framework adapts the @code{fFDR} to leverage informative data from
multiple sets of GWAS summary statistics to increase power in study while
accommodating for linkage disequilibrium. @code{sfFDR} provides estimates of key
FDR quantities in a significance analysis such as the functional local FDR and
q-value, and uses these estimates to derive a functional p-value for type I
error rate control and a functional local Bayes factor for post-GWAS analyses
(e.g., fine mapping and colocalization).  The @code{sfFDR} framework is

et al. (2022) <@code{arXiv:2211.08661v1>}.  The model uses the concept of Self
Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) models to define the node splits and
thus, the model is named SETAR-Tree.  The SETAR-Tree uses some
time-series-specific splitting and stopping procedures.  It trains global pooled
regression models in the leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series
information.  The depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical
linearity test as well as measuring the error reduction percentage at each node
split.  Thus, the SETAR-Tree requires minimal external hyperparameter tuning and
provides competitive results under its default configuration.  A forest is
developed by extending the SETAR-Tree.  The SETAR-Forest combines the forecasts
provided by a collection of diverse SETAR-Trees during the forecasting process.")

thousands of rows of data and a user may wish to analyze hundreds of files at a
time.  Many of the movement variables derivable through this package are

    (description
     "This package implements a regularization method for cumulative link models using
the Smooth-Effect-on-Response Penalty (SERP).  This method allows flexible
modeling of ordinal data by enabling a smooth transition from a general
cumulative link model to a simplified version of the same model.  As the tuning
parameter increases from zero to infinity, the subject-specific effects for each
variable converge to a single global effect.  The approach addresses common
issues in cumulative link models, such as parameter unidentifiability and
numerical instability, by maximizing a penalized log-likelihood instead of the
standard non-penalized version.  Fitting is performed using a modified Newton's
method.  Additionally, the package includes various model performance metrics
and descriptive tools.  For details on the implemented penalty method, see Ugba
(2021) <doi:10.21105/joss.03705> and Ugba et al. (2021)

mixture HMMs, and non-homogeneous HMMs (NHMMs) for social sequence data and
other categorical time series.  Special cases include feedback-augmented NHMMs,
Markov models without latent layer, mixture Markov models, and latent class
models.  The package supports models for one or multiple subjects with one or
multiple parallel sequences (channels).  External covariates can be added to
explain cluster membership in mixture models as well as initial, transition and
emission probabilities in NHMMs. The package provides functions for evaluating
and comparing models, as well as functions for visualizing of multichannel
sequence data and HMMs. For NHMMs, methods for computing average causal effects
and marginal state and emission probabilities are available.  Models are
estimated using maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm or direct numerical
maximization with analytical gradients.  Documentation is available via several
vignettes, and Helske and Helske (2019, <doi:10.18637/jss.v088.i03>).  For
methodology behind the NHMMs, see Helske (2025,

    (description
     "This package provides a modification of the preventive vaccine efficacy trial
design of Gilbert, Grove et al. (2011, Statistical Communications in Infectious
Diseases) is implemented, with application generally to individual-randomized
clinical trials with multiple active treatment groups and a shared control
group, and a study endpoint that is a time-to-event endpoint subject to
right-censoring.  The design accounts for the issues that the efficacy of the
treatment/vaccine groups may take time to accrue while the multiple treatment
administrations/vaccinations are given; there is interest in assessing the
durability of treatment efficacy over time; and group sequential monitoring of
each treatment group for potential harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and
high efficacy is warranted.  The design divides the trial into two stages of
time periods, where each treatment is first evaluated for efficacy in the first
stage of follow-up, and, if and only if it shows significant treatment efficacy
in stage one, it is evaluated for longer-term durability of efficacy in stage
two.  The package produces plots and tables describing operating characteristics
of a specified design including an unconditional power for intention-to-treat
and per-protocol/as-treated analyses; trial duration; probabilities of the
different possible trial monitoring outcomes (e.g., stopping early for
non-efficacy); unconditional power for comparing treatment efficacies; and
distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring after the
treatments/vaccinations are given, useful as input parameters for the design of
studies of the association of biomarkers with a clinical outcome (surrogate
endpoint problem).  The code can be used for a single active treatment versus
control design and for a single-stage design.")

sentiment or topical proportions from the enriched topic models.  Moreover, a
novel method jointly aggregates topic proportions and sentiment measures to
derive time series of topical sentiment.")

estimate the treatment effect.  The hypothesized unmeasured confounder enters
the picture as a missing covariate.  We adopt a state-of-art Expectation
Maximization (EM) algorithm to handle this missing covariate problem in
generalized linear models (GLMs).  As our method also estimates the effect of
each observed covariate on the outcome and treatment assignment, we are able to
calibrate the unmeasured confounder to observed covariates.  Zhang, B., Small,

     "Copula based Cox proportional hazards models for survival data subject to
dependent censoring.  This approach does not assume that the parameter defining
the copula is known.  The dependency parameter is estimated with other finite
model parameters by maximizing a Pseudo likelihood function.  The cumulative
hazard function is estimated via estimating equations derived based on
martingale ideas.  Available copula functions include Frank, Gumbel and Normal
copulas.  Only Weibull and lognormal models are allowed for the censoring model,
even though any parametric model that satisfies certain identifiability
conditions could be used.  Implemented methods are described in the article
\"Copula based Cox proportional hazards models for dependent censoring\" by Deresa

in textual data.  It implements an entity-centered semantic grammar that
distinguishes six classes of motifs: actions of an entity, treatments of an
entity, agents acting upon an entity, patients acted upon by an entity,
characterizations of an entity, and possessions of an entity.  Motifs are
identified by applying a set of extraction rules to a parsed text object that
includes part-of-speech tags and dependency annotations - such as those
generated by spacyr'.  For further reference, see: Stuhler (2022) <doi:

of a kernel to encode our prior knowledge about the data distribution over a
probability space.  The philosophical concept behind our construction is that
objects whose feature values fall on the extreme of that featureâs probability
mass distribution are more similar to each other, than objects whose feature
values lie closer to the mean.  Semblance emphasizes features whose values lie
far away from the mean of their probability distribution.  The kernel relies on
properties empirically determined from the data and does not assume an
underlying distribution.  The use of feature ranks on a probability space
ensures that Semblance is computational efficacious, robust to outliers, and
statistically stable, thus making it widely applicable algorithm for pattern
analysis.  The output from the kernel is a square, symmetric matrix that gives
proximity values between pairs of observations.")

     "Publication bias, the fact that studies identified for inclusion in a meta
analysis do not represent all studies on the topic of interest, is commonly
recognized as a threat to the validity of the results of a meta analysis.  One
way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted
probability distributions.  In this package we provide implementations of
several parametric and nonparametric weight functions.  The novelty in Rufibach
(2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing variant of the nonparametric weight
function of Dear & Begg (1992).  The new approach potentially offers more
insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexible than
parametric approaches.  To maximize the log-likelihood function proposed by Dear
& Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution
algorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al
(2009).  In addition, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the
overall effect size theta, adjusted for selection bias as well as a function
that computes the simulation-based p-value to assess the null hypothesis of no
selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6).")

     "Multi-stage selection is practiced in numerous fields of life and social
sciences and particularly in breeding.  A special characteristic of multi-stage
selection is that candidates are evaluated in successive stages with increasing
intensity and effort, and only a fraction of the superior candidates is selected
and promoted to the next stage.  For the optimum design of such selection
programs, the selection gain plays a crucial role.  It can be calculated by
integration of a truncated multivariate normal (MVN) distribution.  While
mathematical formulas for calculating the selection gain and the variance among
selected candidates were developed long time ago, solutions for numerical
calculation were not available.  This package can also be used for optimizing
multi-stage selection programs for a given total budget and different costs of
evaluating the candidates in each stage.")

     "The aim of most plant breeding programmes is simultaneous improvement of several
characters.  An objective method involving simultaneous selection for several
attributes then becomes necessary.  It has been recognised that most rapid
improvements in the economic value is expected from selection applied
simultaneously to all the characters which determine the economic value of a
plant, and appropriate assigned weights to each character according to their
economic importance, heritability and correlations between characters.  So the
selection for economic value is a complex matter.  If the component characters
are combined together into an index in such a way that when selection is applied
to the index, as if index is the character to be improved, most rapid
improvement of economic value is expected.  Such an index was first proposed by
Smith (1937 <doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02143.x>) based on the Fisher's

    (description
     "The objective of these functions is to derive a species assemblage that
satisfies a functional trait profile.  Restoring resilient ecosystems requires a
flexible framework for selecting assemblages that are based on the functional
traits of species.  However, current trait-based models have been limited to
algorithms that can only select species by optimising specific trait values, and
could not elegantly accommodate the common desire among restoration ecologists
to produce functionally diverse assemblages.  We have solved this problem by
applying a non-linear optimisation algorithm that optimises Rao Q, a closed-form
functional trait diversity index that incorporates species abundances, subject
to other linear constraints.  This framework generalises previous models that
only optimised the entropy of the community, and can optimise both functional
diversity and entropy simultaneously.  This package can also be used to generate
experimental assemblages to test the effects of community-level traits on
community dynamics and ecosystem function.  The method is based on theory
discussed in Laughlin (2014, Ecology Letters) <doi.org/10.1111/ele.12288>.")

package provides time-series processing and clustering functions as described in
the publication.  These are generally applicable where a `k-means` clustering
yields meaningful results, and have been specifically developed for clustering
of the Discrete Fourier Transform of periodic gene expression data (`circadian
or `yeast metabolic oscillations').  This clustering approach is outlined in the
supplemental material of Machne & Murray (2012)
<doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037906>), and here is used as a basis of segment
similarity measures.  Notably, the time-series processing and clustering
functions can also be used as stand-alone tools, independent of segmentation,
e.g., for transcriptome data already mapped to genes.")

segmentation experiments by bootstrapping a critical segmentation magnitude
under the null hypothesis that all key presses were randomly distributed across
the experiment.  Segmentation magnitude is defined as the sum of Gaussians
centered at the times of the segmentation key presses performed by the
participants.  Within a participant, the maximum of the overlaid Gaussians is
used to prevent an excessive influence of a single participant on the overall
outcome (e.g. if a participant is pressing the key multiple times in
succession).  Further functions are included, such as plotting the results.")

segmentation/clustering of bivariate time-series.  Originally intended for
ecological segmentation (home-range and behavioural modes) but easily applied on
other series, the package also provides tools for analysing outputs from R
packages @code{moveHMM} and marcher'.  The segmentation method is a bivariate
extension of Lavielle's method available in @code{adehabitatLT} (Lavielle, 1999
<doi:10.1016/S0304-4149(99)00023-X> and 2005
<doi:10.1016/j.sigpro.2005.01.012>).  This method rely on dynamic programming
for efficient segmentation.  The segmentation/clustering method alternates steps
of dynamic programming with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm.  This is an
extension of Picard et al (2007) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00729.x> method
(formerly available in cghseg package) to the bivariate case.  The method is

time series.  We call this framework FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model
Selection).  FFORMS builds a mapping that relates the features of time series to
the best forecast model using a random forest.  seer package is the
implementation of the FFORMS algorithm.  For more details see our paper at

analysis (CCA) is one of useful statistical methods in multivariate data
analysis, but it is limited in use due to the matrix inversion for large p small
n data.  To overcome this, a seeded CCA has been proposed in Im, Gang and Yoo
(2015) \\doi{10.1002/cem.2691}.  The seeded CCA is a two-step procedure.  The
sets of variables are initially reduced by successively projecting cov(X,Y) or
cov(Y,X) onto cov(X) and cov(Y), respectively, without loss of information on
canonical correlation analysis, following Cook, Li and Chiaromonte (2007)
\\doi{10.1093/biomet/asm038} and Lee and Yoo (2014) \\doi{10.1111/anzs.12057}.
Then, the canonical correlation is finalized with the initially-reduced two sets
of variables.")

     "The explosion of biobank data offers immediate opportunities for
gene-environment (@code{GxE}) interaction studies of complex diseases because of
the large sample sizes and rich collection in genetic and non-genetic
information.  However, the extremely large sample size also introduces new
computational challenges in @code{GxE} assessment, especially for set-based
@code{GxE} variance component (VC) tests, a widely used strategy to boost
overall @code{GxE} signals and to evaluate the joint @code{GxE} effect of
multiple variants from a biologically meaningful unit (e.g., gene).  We present
SEAGLE', a Scalable Exact @code{AlGorithm} for Large-scale Set-based @code{GxE}
tests, to permit @code{GxE} VC test scalable to biobank data.  SEAGLE employs
modern matrix computations to achieve the same âexactâ results as the
original @code{GxE} VC tests, and does not impose additional assumptions nor
relies on approximations.  SEAGLE can easily accommodate sample sizes in the
order of 10^5, is implementable on standard laptops, and does not require
specialized equipment.  The accompanying manuscript for this package can be

multivariate two-sample equivalence test.  Distance measure of the test is the
sum of standardized differences between the expected values or in other words:
the sum of effect sizes (SE) of all components of the two multivariate samples.
The test is an asymptotically valid test for normally distributed data (see
Hoffelder et al.,2015).  The function @code{SE.EQ()} implements the SE-test for
equivalence according to Hoffelder et al. (2015).  The function
@code{SE.EQ.dissolution.profiles()} implements a variant of the SE-test for
equivalence for similarity analyses of dissolution profiles as mentioned in
Suarez-Sharp et al.(2020) <DOI:10.1208/s12248-020-00458-9>).  The equivalence
margin used in @code{SE.EQ.dissolution.profiles()} is analogically defined as
for the T2EQ approach according to Hoffelder (2019)

[\\% of label claim] of both dissolution profile populations.

differences of the expected values of both dissolution profile populations is
statistically significantly smaller than 10 [\\% of label claim].  The weights

to be a good estimate for the true direct effect if we observe many covariates,
e.g., high-dimensional settings, and we have fairly dense confounding.  Even if
the assumptions are violated, it seems like there is not much to lose, and the
deconfounded models will, in general, estimate a function closer to the true one

Mises processes are included, which can be seen as toroidal analogues of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion.  A collection of methods for approximate maximum
likelihood estimation, organized in four blocks, is given: (i) based on the
exact transition probability density, obtained as the numerical solution to the
Fokker-Plank equation; (ii) based on wrapped pseudo-likelihoods; (iii) based on
specific analytic approximations by wrapped processes; (iv) based on maximum
likelihood of the stationary densities.  The package allows the replicability of

    (description
     "This package provides functions for evaluating the stability of low-dimensional
embeddings and cluster assignments in singleâcell RNA sequencing
(@code{scRNAâseq}) datasets.  Starting from a principal component analysis
(PCA) object, users can generate multiple replicates of tâDistributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tâSNE) or Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP) embeddings.  Embedding stability is quantified by computing
pairwise Kendallâs Tau correlations across replicates and summarizing the
distribution of correlation coefficients.  In addition to dimensionality
reduction, @code{scStability} assesses clustering consistency using either
Louvain or Leiden algorithms and calculating the Normalized Mutual Information
(NMI) between all pairs of cluster assignments.  For background on UMAP and
t-SNE algorithms, see @code{McInnes} et al. (2020, <doi:10.21105/joss.00861>)
and van der Maaten & Hinton (2008, <https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne>),

     "Single cell resolution data has been valuable in learning about tissue
microenvironments and interactions between cells or spots.  This package allows
for the simulation of this level of data, be it single cell or âspotsâ, in
both a univariate (single metric or cell type) and bivariate (2 or more metrics
or cell types) ways.  As more technologies come to marker, more methods will be
developed to derive spatial metrics from the data which will require a way to
benchmark methods against each other.  Additionally, as the field currently
stands, there is not a gold standard method to be compared against.  We set out
to develop an R package that will allow users to simulate point patterns that
can be biologically informed from different tissue domains, holes, and varying
degrees of clustering/colocalization.  The data can be exported as spatial files
and a summary file (like HALO').

     "Optimal hard thresholding of singular values.  The procedure adaptively
estimates the best singular value threshold under unknown noise characteristics.
 The threshold chosen by @code{ScreeNOT} is optimal (asymptotically, in the
sense of minimum Frobenius error) under the the so-called \"Spiked model\" of a
low-rank matrix observed in additive noise.  In contrast to previous works, the
noise is not assumed to be i.i.d.  or white; it can have an essentially
arbitrary and unknown correlation structure, across either rows, columns or
both. @code{ScreeNOT} is proposed to practitioners as a mathematically solid
alternative to Cattell's ever-popular but vague Scree Plot heuristic from 1966.

Already in the package are estimators for directional distributions (Mardia,

Polynomially-Tilted Pairwise Interaction model for compositional data.  The
latter estimators perform well when there are zeros in the compositions (Scealy

    (description
     "Unequal granularity of cell type annotation makes it difficult to compare
@code{scRNA-seq} datasets at scale.  Leveraging the ontology system for defining
cell type hierarchy, @code{scOntoMatch} aims to align cell type annotations to
make them comparable across studies.  The alignment involves two core steps:
first is to trim the cell type tree within each dataset so each cell type does
not have descendants, and then map cell type labels cross-studies by direct
matching and mapping descendants to ancestors.  Various functions for plotting
cell type trees and manipulating ontology terms are also provided.  In the
Single Cell Expression Atlas hosted at EBI, a compendium of datasets with
curated ontology labels are great inputs to this package.")

count data.  Included are the Poisson, the negative binomial, the
Poisson-inverse gaussian and, most importantly, a new implementation of the
Poisson-beta distribution (density, distribution and quantile functions, and
random number generator) together with a needed new implementation of Kummer's
function (also: confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind).  Three
different implementations of the Gillespie algorithm allow data simulation based
on the basic, switching or bursting @code{mRNA} generating processes.  Moreover,
likelihood functions for four variants of each of the three aforementioned
distributions are also available.  The variants include one population and two
population mixtures, both with and without zero-inflation.  The package depends
on the MPFR libraries (<https://www.mpfr.org/>) which need to be installed
separately (see description at <https://github.com/fuchslab/@code{scModels>}).
This package is supplement to the paper \"A mechanistic model for the negative

    (description
     "The single cell mapper (@code{scMappR}) R package contains a suite of
bioinformatic tools that provide experimentally relevant cell-type specific
information to a list of differentially expressed genes (DEG).  The function
\"@code{scMappR_and_pathway_analysis}\" reranks DEGs to generate cell-type
specificity scores called cell-weighted fold-changes.  Users input a list of
DEGs, normalized counts, and a signature matrix into this function.
@code{scMappR} then re-weights bulk DEGs by cell-type specific expression from
the signature matrix, cell-type proportions from RNA-seq deconvolution and the
ratio of cell-type proportions between the two conditions to account for changes
in cell-type proportion.  With @code{cwFold-changes} calculated, @code{scMappR}
uses two approaches to utilize @code{cwFold-changes} to complete cell-type
specific pathway analysis.  The \"process_@code{dgTMatrix_lists}\" function in the
@code{scMappR} package contains an automated @code{scRNA-seq} processing
pipeline where users input @code{scRNA-seq} count data, which is made compatible
for @code{scMappR} and other R packages that analyze @code{scRNA-seq} data.  We
further used this to store hundreds up regularly updating signature matrices.
The functions \"tissue_by_celltype_enrichment\", \"tissue_@code{scMappR_internal}\",
and \"tissue_@code{scMappR_custom}\" combine these consistently processed
@code{scRNAseq} count data with gene-set enrichment tools to allow for cell-type
marker enrichment of a generic gene list (e.g. GWAS hits).  Reference:

range of potential applications, including the study of inter-individual
variation at the population-level, patient sub-grouping/stratification, and the
analysis of sample-level batch effects.  Each \"multicellular process\" that is
extracted consists of (A) a multi cell type gene loadings matrix and (B) a
corresponding donor scores vector indicating the level at which the
corresponding loadings matrix is expressed in each donor.  Additional methods
are implemented to aid in selecting an appropriate number of factors and to
evaluate stability of the decomposition.  Additional tools are provided for
downstream analysis, including integration of gene set enrichment analysis and
ligand-receptor analysis.  Tucker, L.R. (1966) <doi:10.1007/BF02289464>.  Unkel,

     "The accumulation of single-cell RNA-seq ('@code{scRNA-seq}') studies highlights
the potential benefits of integrating multiple datasets.  By augmenting sample
sizes and enhancing analytical robustness, integration can lead to more
insightful biological conclusions.  However, challenges arise due to the
inherent diversity and batch discrepancies within and across studies.
SC@code{IntRuler}', a novel R package, addresses these challenges by guiding the
integration of multiple @code{scRNA-seq} datasets.")

     "We develop a novel matrix factorization tool named @code{scINSIGHT} to jointly
analyze multiple single-cell gene expression samples from biologically
heterogeneous sources, such as different disease phases, treatment groups, or
developmental stages.  Given multiple gene expression samples from different
biological conditions, @code{scINSIGHT} simultaneously identifies common and
condition-specific gene modules and quantify their expression levels in each
sample in a lower-dimensional space.  With the factorized results, the inferred
expression levels and memberships of common gene modules can be used to cluster
cells and detect cell identities, and the condition-specific gene modules can
help compare functional differences in transcriptomes from distinct conditions.

optimization process with little effort and clear, beautiful, and clean outputs.
 It can generate graphs using tidyverse to let users check SCF convergence and

     "In some situations where researchers would like to demonstrate causal effects,
it is hard to obtain a sample size that would allow for a well-powered
randomized controlled trial.  Single case designs are experimental designs that
can be used to demonstrate causal effects with only one participant or with only
a few participants.  The scdtb package provides a suite of tools for analyzing
data from studies that use single case designs.  The @code{nap()} function can
be used to compute the nonoverlap of all pairs as outlined by the What Works
Clearinghouse (2022) <https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/Handbooks>.  The package also
offers the @code{mixed_model_analysis()} and @code{cross_lagged()} functions
which implement mixed effects models and cross lagged analyses as described in
Maric & van der Werff (2020) <doi:10.4324/9780429273872-9>.  The
@code{randomization_test()} function implements randomization tests based on
methods presented in Onghena (2020) <doi:10.4324/9780429273872-8>.  The
@code{scdtb()} shiny application can be used to upload single case design data

     "Snow profiles describe the vertical (1D) stratigraphy of layered snow with
different layer characteristics, such as grain type, hardness, deposition date,
and many more.  Hence, they represent a data format similar to multivariate time
series containing categorical, ordinal, and numerical data types.  Use this
package to align snow profiles by matching their individual layers based on
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).  The aligned profiles can then be assessed with an
independent, global similarity measure that is geared towards avalanche hazard
assessment.  Finally, through exploiting data aggregation and clustering
methods, the similarity measure provides the foundation for grouping and
summarizing snow profiles according to similar hazard conditions.  In
particular, this package allows for averaging large numbers of snow profiles
with DTW Barycenter Averaging and thereby facilitates the computation of
individual layer distributions and summary statistics that are relevant for
avalanche forecasting purposes.  For more background information refer to Herla,
Horton, Mair, and Haegeli (2021) <doi:10.5194/gmd-14-239-2021>, Herla, Mair, and

     "In ecology, spatial data is often represented using polygons.  These polygons
can represent a variety of spatial entities, such as ecological patches, animal
home ranges, or gaps in the forest canopy.  Researchers often need to determine
if two spatial processes, represented by these polygons, are independent of each
other.  For instance, they might want to test if the home range of a particular
animal species is influenced by the presence of a certain type of vegetation.
To address this, Godoy et al. (2022) (<doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2022.100695>)
developed conditional Monte Carlo tests.  These tests are designed to assess
spatial independence while taking into account the shape and size of the

     "This package provides a graphical and automated pipeline for the analysis of
short time-series in R ('@code{santaR}').  This approach is designed to
accommodate asynchronous time sampling (i.e.  different time points for
different individuals), inter-individual variability, noisy measurements and
large numbers of variables.  Based on a smoothing splines functional model,
@code{santaR} is able to detect variables highlighting significantly different
temporal trajectories between study groups.  Designed initially for metabolic
phenotyping, @code{santaR} is also suited for other Systems Biology disciplines.
 Command line and graphical analysis (via a shiny application) enable fast and
parallel automated analysis and reporting, intuitive visualisation and
comprehensive plotting options for non-specialist users.")

     "Machine learning is widely used in information-systems design.  Yet, training
algorithms on imbalanced datasets may severely affect performance on unseen
data.  For example, in some cases in healthcare, financial, or internet-security
contexts, certain sub-classes are difficult to learn because they are
underrepresented in training data.  This R package offers a flexible and
efficient solution based on a new synthetic average neighborhood sampling
algorithm ('SANSA'), which, in contrast to other solutions, introduces a novel
âplacementâ parameter that can be tuned to adapt to each datasets unique
manifestation of the imbalance.  More information about the algorithm's
parameters can be found at Nasir et al. (2022) <https://murtaza.cc/SANSA/>.")

\"Checking Memory Access\". .  This feature has to be enabled in the corresponding
binary, eg in R, which is somewhat involved as it also required a current
compiler toolchain which is not yet widely available, or in the case of Windows,
not available at all (via the common Rtools mechanism). .  As an alternative,
pre-built Docker containers such as the Rocker container r-devel-san or the
multi-purpose container r-debug can be used. .  This package then provides a
means of testing the compiler setup as the known code failures provides in the
sample code here should be detected correctly, whereas a default build of R will
let the package pass. .  The code samples are based on the examples from the
Address Sanitizer Wiki at <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki>.")

in observational data with multiple treatments and a binary outcome.  This
approach derives the general bias formula and provides adjusted causal effect
estimates in response to various assumptions about the degree of unmeasured
confounding.  Nested multiple imputation is embedded within the Bayesian
framework to integrate uncertainty about the sensitivity parameters and sampling
variability.  Bayesian Additive Regression Model (BART) is used for outcome
modeling.  The causal estimands are the conditional average treatment effects
(CATE) based on the risk difference.  For more details, see paper: Hu L et al.

the determination of the best stratification of a sampling frame, the one that
ensures the minimum sample cost under the condition to satisfy precision
constraints in a multivariate and multidomain case.  This approach is based on
the use of the genetic algorithm: each solution (i.e.  a particular partition in
strata of the sampling frame) is considered as an individual in a population;
the fitness of all individuals is evaluated applying the Bethel-Chromy algorithm
to calculate the sampling size satisfying precision constraints on the target
estimates.  Functions in the package allows to: (a) analyse the obtained results
of the optimisation step; (b) assign the new strata labels to the sampling
frame; (c) select a sample from the new frame accordingly to the best
allocation.  Functions for the execution of the genetic algorithm are a modified
version of the functions in the genalg package.  M.Ballin, G.Barcaroli (2020)

     "Easily analyze and visualize differences between samples (e.g., benchmark
comparisons, nonresponse comparisons in surveys) on three levels.  The
comparisons can be univariate, bivariate or multivariate.  On univariate level
the variables of interest of a survey and a comparison survey (i.e.  benchmark)
are compared, by calculating one of several difference measures (e.g., relative
difference in mean), and an average difference between the surveys.  On
bivariate level a function can calculate significant differences in correlations
for the surveys.  And on multivariate levels a function can calculate
significant differences in model coefficients between the surveys of comparison.
 All of those differences can be easily plotted and outputted as a table.  For
more detailed information on the methods and example use see Rohr, B., Silber,

the mean outcome in two or more groups at some pre-specified time after
enrollment.  In the presence of missing data auxiliary assumptions are necessary
to perform such comparisons.  One commonly employed assumption is the missing at
random assumption (MAR).  The samon package allows the user to perform a
(parameterized) sensitivity analysis of this assumption.  In particular it can
be used to examine the sensitivity of tests in the difference in outcomes to
violations of the MAR assumption.  The sensitivity analysis can be performed
under two scenarios, a) where the data exhibit a monotone missing data pattern
(see the @code{samon()} function), and, b) where in addition to a monotone
missing data pattern the data exhibit intermittent missing values (see the
@code{samonIM()} function).")

    (description
     "This package provides a new diagram for the verification of vector variables
(wind, current, etc) generated by multiple models against a set of observations
is presented in this package.  It has been designed as a generalization of the
Taylor diagram to two dimensional quantities.  It is based on the analysis of
the two-dimensional structure of the mean squared error matrix between model and
observations.  The matrix is divided into the part corresponding to the relative
rotation and the bias of the empirical orthogonal functions of the data.  The
full set of diagnostics produced by the analysis of the errors between model and
observational vector datasets comprises the errors in the means, the analysis of
the total variance of both datasets, the rotation matrix corresponding to the
principal components in observation and model, the angle of rotation of
model-derived empirical orthogonal functions respect to the ones from
observations, the standard deviation of model and observations, the root mean
squared error between both datasets and the squared two-dimensional correlation
coefficient.  See the output of function @code{UVError()} in this package.")

(SAEM) algorithm, (ii) provides standard errors for the maximum likelihood
estimator (iii) estimates the conditional modes, the conditional means and the
conditional standard deviations of the individual parameters, using the
Hastings-Metropolis algorithm (see Comets et al. (2017)

supplements the functionality of the sae package.  Specifically, it includes
EBLUP fitting of the original Rao-Yu model, which in the original form did not
have a spatial component.  The package also offers a modified ('dynamic')
version of the Rao-Yu model, replacing the assumption of stationarity.  Both
univariate and multivariate applications are supported.  Of particular note is
the allowance for covariance of the area-level sample estimates over time, as
encountered in rotating panel designs such as the U.S. National Crime

    (description
     "This package implements Additive Logistic Transformation (alr) for Small Area
Estimation under Fay Herriot Model.  Small Area Estimation is used to borrow
strength from auxiliary variables to improve the effectiveness of a domain
sample size.  This package uses Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Prediction
(EBLUP).  The Additive Logistic Transformation (alr) are based on transformation
by Aitchison J (1986).  The covariance matrix for multivariate application is
based on covariance matrix used by Esteban M, LombardÃ­a M, LÃ³pez-VizcaÃ­no E,
Morales D, and PÃ©rez A <doi:10.1007/s11749-019-00688-w>.  The non-sampled
models are modified area-level models based on models proposed by Anisa R,
Kurnia A, and Indahwati I <doi:10.9790/5728-10121519>, with univariate model
using model-3, and multivariate model using model-1.  The MSE are estimated
using Parametric Bootstrap approach.  For non-sampled cases, MSE are estimated
using modified approach proposed by Haris F and Ubaidillah A

variation among genes in the same genome.  Seemingly, codon usage bias is
affected by both selective constraints and mutation bias which allows and
enables us to examine and detect changes in these two evolutionary forces
between genomes or along one genome.  Therefore, we determined the codon
adaptation index (CAI), effective number of codons (ENC) and codon usage
analysis with calculation of the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and
subsequently predicted the translation efficiency and accuracy through GC-rich
codon usages.  Furthermore, we estimated the relative stability of the DNA
sequence following calculation of the average free energy (Delta G) and Dimer
base-stacking energy level.")

saccades based on various heuristics, which differ in the assumptions about
velocity, acceleration, etc.  The package uses three methods (Engbert and Kliegl

majority vote approach to identify saccades.  The package includes three methods
but can be extended via custom functions.  It also uses a modular approach to
compute velocity and acceleration from noisy samples.  Finally, you can obtain
methods votes per gaze sample instead of saccades.")

to species with small sample sizes (e.g., poorly sampled species or rare
species).  While these methods can also be used on well-sampled taxa, they are
united by the fact that they can be utilized with relatively few data points.

method extends the supervised elastic-net problem, and thus it is a practical
solution to the problem of feature selection in semi-supervised contexts.  Its
mathematical formulation is presented from a general perspective, covering a
wide range of models.  We focus on linear and logistic responses, but the
implementation could be easily extended to other losses in generalized linear
models.  We develop a flexible and fast implementation, written in C++ using
@code{RcppArmadillo} and integrated into R via Rcpp modules.  See Culp, M. 2013
