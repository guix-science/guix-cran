<doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2005.00594.x> to provide a choice-theoretic
interpretation to instrumental variables models that maintain the monotonicity
condition of Imbens and Angrist (1994) <doi:10.2307/2951620>.  This
interpretation can be used to extrapolate from the compliers to estimate
treatment effects for other subpopulations.  This package provides a flexible
set of methods for conducting this extrapolation.  It allows for parametric or
nonparametric sieve estimation, and allows the user to maintain shape
restrictions such as monotonicity.  The package operates in the general
framework developed by Mogstad, Santos and Torgovitsky (2018)
<doi:10.3982/ECTA15463>, and accommodates either point identification or partial
identification (bounds).  In the partially identified case, bounds are computed
using either linear programming or quadratically constrained quadratic
programming.  Support for four solvers is provided.  Gurobi and the Gurobi R API
can be obtained from <http://www.gurobi.com/index>.  CPLEX can be obtained from

user provides the function, from the real numbers to the real numbers, and an
interval with the property that the values of the function at its endpoints have
different signs.  If the function is continuous over this interval then the ITP
method estimates the value at which the function is equal to zero.  If the
function is discontinuous then a point of discontinuity at which the function
changes sign may be found.  The function can be supplied using either an R
function or an external pointer to a C++ function.  Tuning parameters of the ITP
algorithm can be set by the user.  Default values are set based on arguments in

     "The @code{itdr()} routine allows for the estimation of sufficient dimension
reduction subspaces in univariate regression such as the central mean subspace
or central subspace in regression.  This is achieved using Fourier
transformation methods proposed by Zhu and Zeng (2006)
<doi:10.1198/016214506000000140>, convolution transformation methods proposed by
Zeng and Zhu (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2009.08.004>, and iterative Hessian

<doi:10.1214/aos/1021379861>.  Additionally, @code{mitdr()} function provides
optimal estimators for sufficient dimension reduction subspaces in multivariate
regression by optimizing a discrepancy function using a Fourier transform
approach proposed by Weng and Yin (2022) <doi:10.5705/ss.202020.0312>, and

of Sensitivity to Nonignorability (ISNI) in the generalized linear model for
independent data, and in the marginal multivariate Gaussian model and the
mixed-effects models for continuous and binary longitudinal/clustered data.  It
allows for arbitrary patterns of missingness in the regression outcomes caused
by dropout and/or intermittent missingness.  One can compute the sensitivity
index without estimating any nonignorable models or positing specific magnitude
of nonignorability.  Thus ISNI provides a simple quantitative assessment of how
robust the standard estimates assuming missing at random is with respect to the
assumption of ignorability.  For a tutorial, download at

or another group is to be compared, yielding empirical subgroups to which
minority members are then matched based on how similar they are.  The modelling
of specific outcomes then occurs within specific subgroups in which majority and
minority members are matched.  ISCA is characterized by its data-driven,
probabilistic, and iterative approach and combines fuzzy clustering, Monte Carlo
simulation, and regression analysis. @code{ISCA_random_assignments()} assigns
subjects probabilistically to subgroups. @code{ISCA_clustertable()} provides
summary statistics of each cluster across iterations. @code{ISCA_modeling()}
provides Ordinary Least Squares regression results for each cluster across
iterations.  For further details please see Drouhot (2021) <doi:10.1086/712804>.")

     "Imbalanced domain learning has almost exclusively focused on solving
classification tasks, where the objective is to predict cases labelled with a
rare class accurately.  Such a well-defined approach for regression tasks lacked
due to two main factors.  First, standard regression tasks assume that each
value is equally important to the user.  Second, standard evaluation metrics
focus on assessing the performance of the model on the most common cases.  This
package contains methods to tackle imbalanced domain learning problems in
regression tasks, where the objective is to predict extreme (rare) values.  The
methods contained in this package are: 1) an automatic and non-parametric method
to obtain such relevance functions; 2) visualisation tools; 3) suite of
evaluation measures for optimisation/validation processes; 4) the squared-error
relevance area measure, an evaluation metric tailored for imbalanced regression
tasks.  More information can be found in Ribeiro and Moniz (2020)

accuracy of estimating treatment comparisons in an experiment as they eliminate
the effects of the row and column factors.  However, these designs are not
readily available when the number of treatments is more than the levels of row

row-column designs with incomplete rows and columns, by amalgamating two
incomplete block designs (D1 and D2).  The selection of D1 and D2 (the input
designs) can be done from the available incomplete block designs, viz., balanced
incomplete block designs/ partially balanced incomplete block designs/

    (description
     "This package provides a scaling method to obtain a standardized Moran's I
measure.  Moran's I is a measure for the spatial autocorrelation of a data set,
it gives a measure of similarity between data and its surrounding.  The range of
this value must be [-1,1], but this does not happen in practice.  This package
scale the Moran's I value and map it into the theoretical range of [-1,1].  Once
the Moran's I value is rescaled, it facilitates the comparison between projects,
for instance, a researcher can calculate Moran's I in a city in China, with a
sample size of n1 and area of interest a1.  Another researcher runs a similar
experiment in a city in Mexico with different sample size, n2, and an area of
interest a2.  Due to the differences between the conditions, it is not possible
to compare Moran's I in a straightforward way.  In this version of the package,
the spatial autocorrelation Moran's I is calculated as proposed in Chen(2013)

modalities which potentially differ with respect to their information content in
terms of prediction.  For example, in biomedical applications patient outcome
such as survival time or response to therapy may have to be predicted based on,
say, @code{mRNA} data, @code{miRNA} data, methylation data, CNV data, clinical
data, etc.  The clinical predictors are on average often much more important for
outcome prediction than the @code{mRNA} data.  The ipflasso method takes this
problem into account by using different penalty parameters for predictors from
different modalities.  The ratio between the different penalty parameters can be
chosen from a set of optional candidates by cross-validation or alternatively
generated from the input data.")

digitizing software, such as @code{DigitizeIt} (for MAC or windows) or
@code{ScanIt'(for} windows) can be used to get the coordinates.  Additional
information should also be involved to increase the accuracy, like numbers of
patients at risk (often reported at 5-10 time points under the x-axis of the K-M
graph), total number of patients, and total number of events.  The package
implements the modified iterative K-M estimation algorithm (modified-@code{iKM})

a function to retrieve phylogeny tree that construct a neighbor-joining tree
based on a similar matrix between clusters.  By given multiple Q matrices with
varying a number of ancestors (K), the framework define a similar value between
clusters i,j as a minimum number K* that makes majority of members of two
clusters are in the different clusters.  This K* reflexes a minimum number of
ancestors we need to splitting cluster i,j into different clusters if we assign
K* clusters based on maximum admixture ratio of individuals.  The publication of

     "This package contains functions that allow Bayesian inference on a parameter of
some widely-used exponential models.  The functions can generate independent
samples from the closed-form posterior distribution using the inverse stable
prior.  Inverse stable is a non-conjugate prior for a parameter of an
exponential subclass of discrete and continuous data distributions (e.g.
Poisson, exponential, inverse gamma, double exponential (Laplace),
half-normal/half-Gaussian, etc.).  The prior class provides flexibility in
capturing a wide array of prior beliefs (right-skewed and left-skewed) as
modulated by a parameter that is bounded in (0,1).  The generated samples can be
used to simulate the prior and posterior predictive distributions.  More details
can be found in Cahoy and Sedransk (2019) <doi:10.1007/s42519-018-0027-2>.  The
package can also be used as a teaching demo for introductory Bayesian courses.")

    (description
     "Computes the log likelihood for an inverse gamma stochastic volatility model
using a closed form expression of the likelihood.  The details of the
computation of this closed form expression are given in Gonzalez and Majoni
(2023) <http://rcea.org/@code{RePEc/pdf/wp23-11.pdf>} .  The closed form
expression is obtained for a stationary inverse gamma stochastic volatility
model by marginalising out the volatility.  This allows the user to obtain the
maximum likelihood estimator for this non linear non Gaussian state space model.
 In addition, the user can obtain the estimates of the smoothed volatility using
the exact smoothing distributions.")

    (description
     "This package provides functions for evaluating and testing asset pricing models,
including estimation and testing of factor risk premia, selection of \"strong\"
risk factors (factors having nonzero population correlation with test asset
returns), heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust covariance matrix
estimation and testing for model misspecification and identification.  The
functions for estimating and testing factor risk premia implement the
Fama-@code{MachBeth} (1973) <doi:10.1086/260061> two-pass approach, the
misspecification-robust approaches of Kan-Robotti-Shanken (2013)
<doi:10.1111/jofi.12035>, and the approaches based on tradable factor risk
premia of Quaini-Trojani-Yuan (2023) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.4574683>.  The functions
for selecting the \"strong\" risk factors are based on the Oracle estimator of
Quaini-Trojani-Yuan (2023) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.4574683> and the factor screening
procedure of Gospodinov-Kan-Robotti (2014) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.2579821>.  The
functions for evaluating model misspecification implement the HJ model
misspecification distance of Kan-Robotti (2008)
<doi:10.1016/j.jempfin.2008.03.003>, which is a modification of the prominent
Hansen-Jagannathan (1997) <doi:10.1111/j.1540-6261.1997.tb04813.x> distance.
The functions for testing model identification specialize the Kleibergen-Paap
(2006) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2005.02.011> and the Chen-Fang (2019)
<doi:10.1111/j.1540-6261.1997.tb04813.x> rank test to the regression coefficient
matrix of test asset returns on risk factors.  Finally, the function for
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust covariance estimation implements
the Newey-West (1994) <doi:10.2307/2297912> covariance estimator.")

     "This package provides a user-friendly toolbox for doing the statistical analysis
of interval-valued responses in questionnaires measuring intrinsically imprecise
human attributes or features (attitudes, perceptions, opinions, feelings, etc.).
 In particular, this package provides S4 classes, methods, and functions in
order to compute basic arithmetic and statistical operations with
interval-valued data; prepare customized plots; associate each interval-valued
response to its equivalent Likert-type and visual analogue scales answers
through the minimum theta-distance and the mid-point criteria; analyze the
reliability of respondents answers from the internal consistency point of view
by means of Cronbach's alpha coefficient; and simulate interval-valued responses
in this type of questionnaires.  The package also incorporates some real-life
data that can be used to illustrate its working with several non-trivial
reproducible examples.  The methodology used in this package is based in many
theoretical and applied publications from SMIRE+@code{CoDiRE} (Statistical
Methods with Imprecise Random Elements and Comparison of Distributions of Random
Elements) Research Group (<https://bellman.ciencias.uniovi.es/smire+codire/>)

     "Facilitates spatial and general latent Gaussian modeling using integrated nested
Laplace approximation via the INLA package (<https://www.r-inla.org>).
Additionally, extends the GAM-like model class to more general nonlinear
predictor expressions, and implements a log Gaussian Cox process likelihood for
modeling univariate and spatial point processes based on ecological survey data.
 Model components are specified with general inputs and mapping methods to the
latent variables, and the predictors are specified via general R expressions,
with separate expressions for each observation likelihood model in
multi-likelihood models.  A prediction method based on fast Monte Carlo sampling
allows posterior prediction of general expressions of the latent variables.

Mariani et al. (2022b) <doi:10.1007/s10287-022-00422-2> to gross returns of
financial assets.  This is accomplished through an adaptive algorithm that
identifies sub-groups of gross returns in each iteration by approximating their
distribution with a sequence of two-component log-normal mixtures.  These
sub-groups emerge when a significant change in the distribution occurs below the
median of the financial returns, with their boundary termed as the âchange
point\" of the mixture.  The process concludes when no further change points are
detected.  The outcome encompasses parameters of the leftmost mixture
distributions and change points of the analyzed financial time series.  The
functionalities of the INFOSET package include: (i) modelling asset distribution
detecting the parameters which describe left tail behaviour (infoset function),
(ii) clustering, (iii) labeling of the financial series for predictive and
classification purposes through a Left Risk measure based on the first change
point (LR_cp function) (iv) portfolio construction (ptf_construction function).

single units are omitted from the data, models based on these data should not
produce substantially different estimates.  To standardize the assessment of how
influential a (single group of) observation(s) is, several measures of influence
are common practice, such as Cook's Distance.  In addition, we provide a measure
of percentage change of the fixed point estimates and a simple procedure to
detect changing levels of significance.")

non-linear alignments of time series to match similar patterns in time series of
different lengths and or different speeds. @code{IncDTW} is characterized by (1)
the incremental calculation of DTW (reduces runtime complexity to a linear level
for updating the DTW distance) - especially for life data streams or subsequence
matching, (2) the vector based implementation of DTW which is faster because no
matrices are allocated (reduces the space complexity from a quadratic to a
linear level in the number of observations) - for all runtime intensive DTW
computations, (3) the subsequence matching algorithm @code{runDTW}, that
efficiently finds the k-NN to a query pattern in a long time series, and (4) C++
in the heart.  For details about DTW see the original paper \"Dynamic programming
algorithm optimization for spoken word recognition\" by Sakoe and Chiba (1978)

     "This software does Multi-Reader, Multi-Case (MRMC) analyses of data from imaging
studies where clinicians (readers) evaluate patient images (cases).  What does
this mean? ...  Many imaging studies are designed so that every reader reads
every case in all modalities, a fully-crossed study.  In this case, the data is
cross-correlated, and we consider the readers and cases to be cross-correlated
random effects.  An MRMC analysis accounts for the variability and correlations
from the readers and cases when estimating variances, confidence intervals, and
p-values.  The functions in this package can treat arbitrary study designs and
studies with missing data, not just fully-crossed study designs.  An overview of
this software, including references presenting details on the methods, can be

    (description
     "Missing values often occur in financial data due to a variety of reasons (errors
in the collection process or in the processing stage, lack of asset liquidity,
lack of reporting of funds, etc.).  However, most data analysis methods expect
complete data and cannot be employed with missing values.  One convenient way to
deal with this issue without having to redesign the data analysis method is to
impute the missing values.  This package provides an efficient way to impute the
missing values based on modeling the time series with a random walk or an
autoregressive (AR) model, convenient to model log-prices and log-volumes in
financial data.  In the current version, the imputation is univariate-based (so
no asset correlation is used).  In addition, outliers can be detected and
removed.  The package is based on the paper: J. Liu, S. Kumar, and D. P. Palomar

discussed problems of theory in their discipline for a long time, weak theories

psychologists lack the tools to systematically assess the quality of their
theories.  Previously a computational model for formal theory evaluation based
on the concept of explanatory coherence was developed (Thagard, 1989,
<doi:10.1017/S0140525X00057046>).  However, there are possible improvements to
this model and it is not available in software that psychologists typically use.
 Therefore, a new implementation of explanatory coherence based on the Ising
model is available in this R-package.")

begins with a accept/reject approximate bayes computation (ABC) step applied to
a sample of points from the prior distribution of model parameters.  Accepted
points result in model predictions that are within the initially specified
tolerance intervals around the target points.  The sample is iteratively updated
by drawing additional points from a mixture of multivariate normal
distributions, accepting points within tolerance intervals.  As the algorithm
proceeds, the acceptance intervals are narrowed.  The algorithm returns a set of
points and sampling weights that account for the adaptive sampling scheme.  For

    (description
     "The Importance Index (I.I.) can determine the loss and solution sources for a
system in certain knowledge areas (e.g., agronomy), when production (e.g.,
fruits) is known (Demolin-Leite, 2021).  Events (e.g., agricultural pest) can
have different magnitudes (numerical measurements), frequencies, and
distributions (aggregate, random, or regular) of event occurrence, and I.I.
bases in this triplet (Demolin-Leite, 2021)
<https://cjascience.com/index.php/CJAS/article/view/1009/1319>.  Usually, the
higher the magnitude and frequency of aggregated distribution, the greater the
problem or the solution (e.g., natural enemies versus pests) for the system
(Demolin-Leite, 2021).  However, the final production of the system is not
always known or is difficult to determine (e.g., degraded area recovery).  A
derivation of the I.I. is the percentage of Importance Index-Production Unknown
(% I.I.-PU) that can detect the loss or solution sources, when production is
unknown for the system (Demolin-Leite, 2024) <DOI:10.1590/1519-6984.253218>.")

    (description
     "Interpreting the differences between mean scale scores across various forms of
an assessment can be challenging.  This difficulty arises from different
mappings between raw scores and scale scores, complex mathematical
relationships, adjustments based on judgmental procedures, and diverse equating
functions applied to different assessment forms.  An alternative method involves
running simulations to explore the effect of incrementing raw scores on mean
scale scores.  The idmact package provides an implementation of this approach
based on the algorithm detailed in Schiel (1998)
<https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/ACT_RR98-01.pdf> which
was developed to help interpret differences between mean scale scores on the
American College Testing (ACT) assessment.  The function @code{idmact_subj()}
within the package offers a framework for running simulations on subject-level
scores.  In contrast, the @code{idmact_comp()} function provides a framework for
conducting simulations on composite scores.")

    (description
     "In randomized studies involving severely ill patients, functional outcomes are
often unobserved due to missed clinic visits, premature withdrawal or death.  It
is well known that if these unobserved functional outcomes are not handled
properly, biased treatment comparisons can be produced.  In this package, we
implement a procedure for comparing treatments that is based on the composite
endpoint of both the functional outcome and survival.  The procedure was
proposed in Wang et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1111/biom.12594> and Wang et al. (2020)
<DOI:10.18637/jss.v093.i12>.  It considers missing data imputation with
different sensitivity analysis strategies to handle the unobserved functional
outcomes not due to death.")

spatially-varying kernels are allowed.  Data used to estimate the parameters are
assumed to be readings of the process corrupted by Gaussian measurement error.

exactly but can be deduced to fall within a given interval.  For example, some
medical conditions like bone mineral density deficiency are generally only
diagnosed at clinical visits.  If a patient goes for clinical checkups yearly
and is diagnosed at, say, age 30, then the onset of the deficiency is only known
to fall between the date of their age 29 checkup and the date of the age 30
checkup.  Interval-censored data include right- and left-censored data as

    (description
     "Single Layer Feed-forward Neural networks (SLFNs) have many applications in
various fields of statistical modelling, especially for time-series forecasting.
 However, there are some major disadvantages of training such networks via the
widely accepted gradient-based backpropagation algorithm, such as convergence to
local minima, dependencies on learning rate and large training time.  These
concerns were addressed by Huang et al. (2006)
<doi:10.1016/j.neucom.2005.12.126>, wherein they introduced the Extreme Learning
Machine (ELM), an extremely fast learning algorithm for SLFNs which randomly
chooses the weights connecting input and hidden nodes and analytically
determines the output weights of SLFNs.  It shows good generalized performance,
but is still subject to a high degree of randomness.  To mitigate this issue,
this package uses a dimensionality reduction technique given in Hyvarinen (1999)
<doi:10.1109/72.761722>, namely, the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to
determine the input-hidden connections and thus, remove any sort of randomness
from the algorithm.  This leads to a robust, fast and stable ELM model.  Using
functions within this package, the proposed model can also be compared with an
existing alternative based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm
given by Pearson (1901) <doi:10.1080/14786440109462720>, i.e., the PCA based ELM
model given by Castano et al. (2013) <doi:10.1007/s11063-012-9253-x>, from which
the implemented ICA based algorithm is greatly inspired.")

unsupervised and supervised models to best suit their research.  In addition,
the toolkit provides 2D and 3D interactive visualizations, differential
expression analysis, filters based on cells, genes and clusters, data merging,
normalizing for dropouts, data imputation methods, correcting for batch
differences, pathway analysis, tools to find marker genes for clusters and
conditions, predict cell types and pseudotime analysis.  See Khodadadi-Jamayran,

each phylogenetic group ('bin').  Each bin usually consists of different taxa

phylogenetic distance calculation, phylogenetic signal test within phylogenetic

package enables users to simulate population evolution, in which individuals are
characterized by their age and some characteristics, and the population is
modified by different types of events, including births/arrivals, death/exit
events, or changes of characteristics.  The frequency at which an event can
occur to an individual can depend on their age and characteristics, but also on
the characteristics of other individuals (interactions).  Such models have a
wide range of applications.  For instance, IBMs can be used for simulating the
evolution of a heterogeneous insurance portfolio with selection or for
validating mortality forecasts.  This package overcomes the limitations of
time-consuming IBMs simulations by implementing new efficient algorithms based
on thinning methods, which are compiled using the Rcpp package while providing a
user-friendly interface.")

code, the effect size for the participant, and whether that participant should
be excluded based on the criteria outlined by Greenwald et al. (2003).  Data
files should consist of six columns organized in order as follows: Block (0-6),
trial (0-19 for training blocks, 0-39 for test blocks), category (dependent on
your IAT), the type of item within that category (dependent on your IAT), a
dummy variable indicating whether the participant was correct or incorrect on

IAT scores are calculated as specified by Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003)

IAT effect size for the participant's dataset, (2) the effect size calculated
for odd trials only, (3) the effect size calculated for even trials only, and
(4) the proportion of trials with reaction times under 300ms (which is important
for exclusion purposes).  Items (2) and (3) allow for a measure of the internal
consistency of the IAT. Specifically, you can use the subsetted IAT effect sizes
for odd and even trials to calculate Cronbach's alpha across participants in the
sample.  The input function consists of three arguments.  First, indicate the
name of the dataset to be analyzed.  This is the only required input.  Second,

    (description
     "This package provides functions to conduct a model-agnostic asymptotic
hypothesis test for the identification of interaction effects in black-box
machine learning models.  The null hypothesis assumes that a given set of
covariates does not contribute to interaction effects in the prediction model.
The test statistic is based on the difference of variances of partial dependence
functions (Friedman (2008) <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148> and Welchowski (2022)
<doi:10.1007/s13253-021-00479-7>) with respect to the original black-box
predictions and the predictions under the null hypothesis.  The hypothesis test
can be applied to any black-box prediction model, and the null hypothesis of the
test can be flexibly specified according to the research question of interest.
Furthermore, the test is computationally fast to apply as the null distribution
does not require resampling or refitting black-box prediction models.")
