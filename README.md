# Guix CRAN channel

This channel complements GNU Guixâ€™ CRAN collection and contains
all R packages not available in Guix yet. The import is [fully
automated](https://github.com/guix-science/guix-cran-scripts) and thus
no quality control exists. Packages may or may not build, they may or
may not work. Pull requests are not accepted.

You can use this channel by adding the following snippet to your
`~/.config/guix/channels.scm` and then running `guix pull`:

```scheme
(cons
  (channel
    (name 'guix-cran)
    (url "https://github.com/guix-science/guix-cran.git"))
  %default-channels)
```

Binary substitutes for `x86_64-linux` are available
from https://substitutes.guix.psychnotebook.org/ and

Servers](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Getting-Substitutes-from-Other-Servers)
