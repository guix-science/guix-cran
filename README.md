# Guix CRAN channel

This channel complements GNU Guixâ€™ CRAN collection and contains
all R packages not available in Guix yet. The import is [fully
automated](https://github.com/guix-science/guix-cran-scripts) and thus
no quality control exists. Packages may or may not build, they may or
may not work. Pull requests are not accepted.
